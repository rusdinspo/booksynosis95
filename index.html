<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Fine Art of Chinese Brush Painting</h2><p>This extraordinary on-the-page class in brush painting explores both the technical and spiritual aspects of China&#x2019;s ancient art, helping students to paint with confidence, skill, and understanding. Lavishly packed with breathtaking illustrations and detailed instructional photos, it discusses materials, styles, and themes, as well as special topics such as the influence of calligraphy on painting, the importance of arranging the workspace properly, and the use of a seal to sign&#x201d; the finished work. Each chapter is like a perfectly formed monograph rich in information on inks, papers, art utensils, holding the brush correctly, making exquisite-looking strokes and pictograms, applying color, and mastering the techniques for representing vegetation, animals, the human figure, portraits, and evocative landscapes. Well-constructed practice exercises complete this enlightening course.</p><p>Chinese brush painting cuts to the core of its subject, revealing its essence in a few, or sometimes even a single, definitive stroke. A brief history of this timeless art, which involves the graphic depiction of the universe's harmony rather than realistic representation, begins the volume, and an orientation to landscape, birds, and flowers helps ground the reader before progressing to the practical concerns of brushes, inks, and paper (a Chinese invention). Following well-illustrated examples of brush uses and strokes, this survey analyzes the relationship between calligraphy and Chinese brush painting before summarizing techniques for rendering vegetation, animals, the human figure, portraits, and landscapes, the latter constituting the tradition's most frequent subject matter. Discussion of tools and supplies and step-by-step instructions with numerous full-color illustrations make this a valuable resource for painters of all levels. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It was a strange place for the procession of a great man to rest: there was no tavern in sight, not even a peasant's hovel. The big sleeping carriage, pulled by eight horses, halted first. The others - there were probably four in all - slowed down and stopped alongside the first on the grass as the footmen and cavalry escort ran to see what was happening. The passengers threw open their carriage doors. When they heard the despair in their master's voice, they hurried towards his carriage.<br><br>`That's enough!' said Prince Potemkin. `That's enough! There is no point in going on now.' Inside the sleeping carriage, there were three harassed doctors and a slim countess with high cheekbones and auburn hair, all crowded round the Prince. He was sweating and groaning. The doctors summoned the Cossacks to move their massive patient. `Take me out of the carriage...' Potemkin ordered. Everyone jumped when he commanded, and he had commanded virtually everything in Russia for a long time. Cossacks and generals gathered round the open door and slowly, gently began to bear out the stricken giant.<br><br>The Countess accompanied him out of the carriage, holding his hand, dabbing his hot brow as tears streamed down her face with its small retrousse nose and full mouth. A couple of p0Moldavian peasants who tended cattle on the nearby steppe ambled over to watch. His bare feet came first, then his legs and his half-open dressing gown - though this vision in itself was not unusual. Potemkin notoriously greeted empresses and ambassadors in bare feet and open dressing gowns. But now it was different. He still had the leonine Slavic handsomeness, the thick head of hair, once regarded as the finest in the Empire, and the sensual Grecian profile that had won him the nickname 'Alcibiades" as a young man. However, his hair was now flecked with grey and hung over his feverish forehead. He was still gigantic in stature and breadth. Everything about him was exaggerated, colossal and original, but his life of reckless indulgence and relentless ambition had bloated his body and aged his face. Like a Cyclops he had only one eye; the other was blind and damaged, giving him the appearance of a pirate. His chest was broad and hairy. Always a force of nature, he now resembled nothing so much as a magnificent animal reduced to this twitching, shivering pile of flesh.<br><br>The apparition on this wild steppe was His Most Serene Highness Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin, probably husband of the Empress of Russia, Catherine the Great, and certainly the love of her life, the best friend of the woman, the co-ruler of her Empire and the partner in her dreams. He was Prince of Taurida, Field-Marshal, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, Grand Herman of the Black Sea and Ekaterinoslav Cossacks, Grand Admiral of the Black Sea and Caspian Fleets, President of the College of War, viceroy of the south, and possibly the next King of Poland, or of some other principality of his own making.<br><br>The Prince, or Serenissimus, as he was known across the Russian Empire, had ruled with Catherine 11 for nearly two decades. They had known each other for thirty years and had shared each other's lives for almost twenty. Beyond that, the Prince defied, and still defies, all categorization. Catherine noticed him as a witty young man and summoned him to be her lover at a time of crisis. When their affair ended, he remained her friend, partner and minister and became her co-Tsar. She always feared, respected and loved him - but their relationship was stormy. She called him her `Colossus', and her `tiger', her `idol', `hero', the `greatest eccentric'.' This was the `genius" who hugely increased her Empire, created Russia's Black Sea Fleet, conquered the Crimea, won the Second Turkish War and founded famed cities such as Sebastopol and Odessa. Russia had not possessed an imperial statesman of such success in both dreams and deeds since Peter the Great.<br><br>Serenissimus made his own policies - sometimes inspired, sometimes quixotic - and constructed his own world. While his power depended on his partnership with Catherine, he thought and behaved like one of the sovereign powers of Europe. Potemkin dazzled its Cabinets and Courts with his titanic achievements, erudite knowledge and exquisite taste, while simultaneously scandalizing them with his arrogance and debauchery, indolence and luxury. While hating him for his power and inconsistency, even his enemies acclaimed his intelligence and creativity.<br>Now this barefoot Prince half staggered - and was half carried by his Cossacks across the grass. This was a remote and spectacular spot, not even on the main road between Jassy, in today's Rumania, and Kishnev, in today's Republic of Moldova. In those days, this was the territory of the Ottoman Sultan, conquered by Potemkin. Even today it is hard to find, but in 200 years it has hardly changed. The spot where they laid Potemkin was a little plateau beside a steep stone lane whence one could see far in every direction. The countryside to the right was a rolling green valley rising in a multitude of green, bushy mounds into the distance, covered in the now almost vanished high grass of the steppes. To the left, forested hills fell away into the mist. Straight ahead, Potemkin's entourage would have seen the lane go down and then rise up a higher hill covered in dark. trees and thick bushes, disappearing down the valley. Potemkin, who loved to drive his carriage at night through the rain,' had called a stop in a place of the wildest and most beautiful natural drama.'<br><br>His entourage could only have added to it. The confection of the exotic and the civilized in Potemkin's companions that day reflected his contradictions: `Prince Potemkin is the emblem of the immense Russian Empire,' wrote the Prince de Ligne, who knew him well, `he too is composed of deserts and goldmines.'' His Court - for he was almost royal, though Catherine teasingly called it his `bassecour', halfway between a royal court and a farmyard' emerged on to the steppe.<br><br>Many of his attendants were already weeping. The Countess, the only woman present, wore the long-sleeved flowing Russian robes favoured by her friend the Empress, but her stockings and shoes were the finest of French fashion, ordered from Paris by Serenissimus himself. Her travelling jewellery was made up of priceless diamonds from Potemkin's unrivalled collection. Then there were generals and counts in tailcoats and uniforms with sashes and medals and tricorn hats that would not have been remarkable at Horse-Guards in London or any eighteenth-century court, but there was also a sprinkling of Cossack atamans, Oriental princelings, Moldavian boyars, renegade Ottoman pashas, servants, clerks, common soldiers - and the bishops, rabbis, fakirs and mullahs whose company Potemkin most enjoyed. Nothing relaxed him as much as a discussion on Byzantine theology, the customs of some Eastern tribe such as the Bashkirs, or Palladian architecture, Dutch painting, Italian music, English Gardens . . .<br>li0The bishops sported the flowing robes of Orthodoxy, the rabbis the tangled ringlets of Judaism, the Ottoman renegades the turbans, pantaloons and slippers of the Sublime Porte. The Moldavians, Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Sultan, wore bejewelled kaftans and high hats encircled with fur and encrusted with rubies, the ordinary Russian soldiers the 'Potemkin' hats, coats, soft boots and buckskin trousers designed for their ease by the Prince himself. Lastly the Cossacks, most of them Boat Cossacks known as Zaporogians, had fierce moustaches and shaven heads except for a tuft on top leading down the back in a long ponytail, like characters from Last o f the Mohicans, and brandished short curved daggers, engraved pistols and their special long lances. They watched sadly, for Potemkin adored the Cossacks.<br><br>The woman was Potemkin's shrewd and haughty niece, Countess Alexandra Branicka, aged thirty-seven and a formidable political force in her own right. Potemkin's love affairs with the Empress and a brazen parade of noblewomen and courtesans had shocked even French courtiers who remembered Louis XV's Versailles. Had he really made all five of his legendarily beautiful nieces into his mistresses? Did he love Countess Branicka the most of all?<br><br>The Countess ordered them to place a rich Persian rug on the grass. Then she let them lower Prince Potemkin gently on to it. `I want to die in the field,' he said as they settled him there. He had spent the previous fifteen years travelling as fast across Russia's vastness as any man in the eighteenth century: `a trail of sparks marks his swift journey', wrote the poet Gavrili Derzhavin in his ode to Potemkin, The Waterfall. So, appropriately for a man of perpetual movement, who barely lived in his innumerable palaces, Serenissimus added that he did not want to die in a carriage.y He wanted to sleep out on the steppe.<br><br>That morning, Potemkin asked his beloved Cossacks to build him a makeshift tent of their lances, covered with blankets and furs. It was a characteristically Potemkinian idea, as if the purity of a little Cossack camp would cure him of all his suffering.<br><br>The anxious doctors, a Frenchman and two Russians, gathered round the prone Prince and the attentive Countess, but there was little they could do. Catherine and Potemkin thought doctors made better players at the card table than healers at the bedside. The Empress joked that her Scottish doctor finished off most of his patients with his habitual panacea for every ailment a weakening barrage of emetics and bleedings. The doctors were afraid that they would be blamed if the Prince perished, because accusations of poisoning were frequently whispered at the Russian Court. Yet the eccentric Potemkin had been a thoroughly uncooperative patient, opening all the windows, having eau-de-Cologne poured on his head, consuming whole salted geese from Hamburg with gallons of wine - and now setting off on this tormented journey across the steppes.<br><br>The Prince was dressed in a rich silk dressing gown, lined with fur, sent to him days earlier by the Empress all the way from distant St Petersburg, almost two thousand versts. Its inside pockets bulged with bundles of the Empress's secret letters in which she consulted her partner, gossiped with her friend and decided the policies of her Empire. She destroyed most of his letters, but we are grateful that he romantically kept many of hers in that sentimental pocket next to his heart.<br><br>Twenty years of these letters reveal an equal and amazingly successful partnership of two statesmen and lovers that was startling in its modernity, touching in its ordinary intimacy and impressive in its statecraft. Their love affair and political alliance was unequalled in history by Antony and Cleopatra, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon and Josephine, because it was as remarkable for its achievements as for its romance, as endearing for its humanity as for its power. Like everything to do with Potemkin, his life with Catherine was crisscrossed with mysteries: were they secretly married? Did they conceive a child together? Did they really share power? Is it true that they agreed to remain partners while indulging themselves with a string of other lovers? Did Potemkin pimp for the Empress, procuring her young favourites, and did she help him seduce his nieces and turn the Imperial Palace into his own family harem?<br><br>As his illness ebbed and flowed, his travels were pursued by Catherine's caring, wifely notes, as she sent dressing gowns and fur coats for him to wear, scolded him for eating too much or not taking his medicines, begged him to rest and recover, and prayed to God not to take her beloved. He wept as he read them.<br><br>At this very moment, the Empress's couriers were galloping in two directions across Russia, changing their exhausted horses at imperial post-houses. They came from St Petersburg, bearing Catherine's latest letter to the Prince, and from here in Moldavia they bore his latest to her. It had been so for a long time - and they were always longing to receive the freshest news of the other. But now the letters were sadder.<br><br>`My dear friend, Prince Grigory Alexandrovich,' she wrote on 3 October, `I received your letters of the 25th and 27th today a few hours ago and I confess that I am extremely worried by them .. . I pray God that He gives health back to you soon.' She was not worried when she wrote this, because it usually took ten days for letters to reach the capital from the south, though it could be done in seven, hell for leather. Ten days before, Potemkin appeared to have recovered - hence Catherine's calmness. But a few days earlier on 30 September, before his health seemed to improve, her letters were almost frantic. `My worry about your sickness knows no bounds,' she had written. `For Christ's sake, if necessary, take whatever the doctors think might ease your condition. I beg God to give you your energy and health back as soon as possible. Goodbye my friend ... I'm sending you a fur coat ...'. This was just sound and fury - for, while the coat was sent on earlier, neither of the letters reached him in time.<br><br>Somewhere in the 2,000 versts that separated the two of them, the couriers must have crossed paths. Catherine would not have been so optimistic if she had read Potemkin's letter, written on 4 October, the day before, as he set out. `Matushka [Little Mother] Most Merciful Lady,' he dictated to his secretary, `I have no energy left to suffer my torments. The only escape is to leave this town and I have ordered them to carry me to Nikolaev. I do not know what will become of me. Most faithful and grateful subject.' This was written in the secretary's hand but pathetically, at the bottom of the letter, Potemkin scrawled in a weak, angular and jumping hand: `The only escape is to leave.' It was unsigned.<br><br>The last batch of Catherine's letters to reach him had arrived the day before in the pouch of Potemkin's fastest courier, Brigadier Bauer, the devoted adjutant whom he often sent galloping to Paris to bring back silk stockings, to Astrakhan for sterlet soup, to Petersburg for oysters, to Moscow to bring back a dancer or a chessplayer, to Milan for a sheet of music, a virtuoso violinist or a wagon of perfumes. So often and so far had Bauer travelled on Potemkin's whim that he jokingly requested this for his epitaph: `Cy git Bauer sous ce rocher, Fouette, cocher!' ('Here lies Bauer under this stone, Coachman, drive on.!'<br><br>As they gathered round him on the steppe, the officials and courtiers would have reflected on the implications of this scene .for Europe, for their Empress, for the unfinished war with the Turks, for the possibilities of action against revolutionary France and defiant Poland. Potemkin's armies and fleets had conquered huge tracts of Ottoman territory around the Black Sea and in today's Rumania: now the Sultan's Grand Vizier hoped to negotiate a peace with him.

She lives with her husband and two children in Walla Walla, Washington.Grade 1-4-In this poignant account of a pioneer family's experiences, Annie relates how she and her family leave their home and journey west. While her father sees the promise of new land just waiting to be claimed, her mother feels the sorrow of saying good-bye to loved ones. On the morning of their departure, each of Momma's friends gives her a small white packet. Life is hard on the prairie, and when the woman gives birth to a baby girl in the spring, she is too sad to name her. With the help of her father and brother, Annie clears a patch of earth for a kitchen garden. Realizing Annie's intentions, her mother asks her to bring the packets, which contain seeds for daisies, larkspur, poppies, and hollyhocks. Momma rolls up her sleeves to begin planting, finally ready to make this place her home. Using clear language with a homespun flair, Hopkinson captures a child's perception of events. The illustrations, breathtakingly executed in gouache and oil paints, effectively depict the windswept prairie. Young readers will appreciate the work and adversities the pioneers faced and what they had to do to prepare the land for the nonnative trees, flowers, and plants that have survived long after.

But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling, Eragon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself. Overnight his simple life is shattered, and he is thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic, and power. With only an ancient sword and the advice of an old storyteller for guidance, Eragon and the fledgling dragon must navigate the dangerous terrain and dark enemies of an Empire ruled by a king whose evil knows no bounds. Can Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders? The fate of the Empire may rest in his hands....</p><p>Here's a great big fantasy that you can pull over your head like a comfy old sweater and disappear into for a whole weekend. Christopher Paolini began <i>Eragon</i> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p> Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. </p><p> In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <i>Eldest</i>. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Eragon is a very special book. It is a great story, one that will you'll remember long after you finish it. Eragon inspires passion in fans. We invite you to read Eragon and see for yourself what the buzz is all about. <p>Eragon was nominated for the American Library Association 2003 Best Books For Young Adults Award.</p></p><h2>The Portlandia Activity Book</h2><p><p>This is <i>The Portlandia Activity Book</i> a compendium of guaranteed enrichment for the Pacific Northwestern part of your psyche.

There is perhaps nothing that brings more angst to a parent&#39;s heart than waiting for a prodigal to return home. Beloved author Ruth Bell Graham knew about prodigals--two of her five children were spiritual wanderers. In this time-tested classic, she offers encouragement to those who anxiously wait. This is not a &#34;how to&#34; book that dispenses advice on ways to win back a prodigal. Instead, it is a collection of readings one woman turned to for comfort when her children wandered from God. It shows how Graham&#39;s faith persevered and grew regardless of the outcome of her prodigals&#39; stories. In Part One, Graham introduces you to five prodigals who &#34;returned to the father.&#34; In Part Two, she offers comfort and encouragement through Scripture, poems, hymns, prayers, and more. You will be touched by the honest feelings of pain, frustration, and uncertainty Graham expresses so eloquently. And you will share in the lessons she learned about God&#39;s sovereignty and ultimate peace. Now beautifully repackaged, Prodigals and Those Who Love Them brings peace and hope to all parents of &#34;wayward&#34; children.

In 1983, Harold and Sandra were visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when they came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image provided the inspiration for ""Good Dog, Carl,"" which successfully began what would become an increasingly popular picture book series. The Darling's own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the first book's main character. Since then, three other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels.

Visit www.elainecoffman.com.The bone-chilling dampness of Scotland and the crackle of a hearth fire are nearly palpable in Coffman's (The Italian, etc.) atmospheric 18th-century Highland romance. Desperate to escape an arranged marriage to the narcissistic English Lord Rockingham, legendary French beauty Sophie D'Alembert, granddaughter of Louis XIV, slips out of the country on a boat bound for Norway. Her circumstances change abruptly when the ship gets caught in a storm and wrecks off the coast of Scotland. Nearly dead from battling the frigid seas, Sophie is rescued by a gallant young Scotsman who entrusts her to his imposing older brother, Jamie, the earl of Monleigh. Uncertain of the earl's political leanings and unwilling to be sent back to France or to Lord Rockingham, Sophie feigns amnesia. Jamie mistrusts Sophie, but he's unable to resist his growing attraction to her. It soon becomes apparent, however, that the couple can't avoid Rockingham indefinitely. The manner in which Sophie and Jamie finally overcome Rockingham will make some readers raise their eyebrows in disbelief, but the events leading up to their confrontation are compelling. This lush, well-told tale will remind readers why the Highlands are such a popular and superb setting for romance. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I Am Not a Short Adult!: Getting Good at Being a Kid (A Brown Paper School Book)</h2><p>Deals with various aspects of childhood including family, school, money, legal rights, TV and movies, body language, and generally, how to make the most of childhood right now.</p><p></p><h2>Citizen of the Galaxy</h2><p>A youth who has known only the primitive life of a galaxy slave is purchased by a beggar who turns out to be a man with many extracurricular activities.</p><p>Like many people, I go way, way back with Heinlein.

Chalker was also a Baltimore City Schools history teacher in Maryland for 12 years, retiring in 1978 to write full-time. He also was a member of the Washington Science Fiction Association and was involved in the founding of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society. ~~~ The writers he liked to read included Eric Frank Russell, James White, some Philip Jos� Farmer, the early work of Raymond F. Jones and Robert A. Heinlein, Jack Vance, and others too numerous to mention. From January 1965 to November 2004, he missed only one World Science Fiction Convention. ~~~ Chalker&#39;s awards included the Daedalus Award (1983), The Gold Medal of the West Coast Review of Books (1984), Skylark Award (1980), Hamilton-Brackett Memorial Award (1979), as well as others of varying prestige. He was a nominee for the John W. Campbell Award twice and for the Hugo Award twice. He was posthumously awarded the Phoenix Award by the Southern Fandom Confederation on April 9, 2005. In 1967 Chalker founded the Baltimore Science Fiction Society and he was a 3-term treasurer of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Chalker was also the co-author (with Mark Owings) of The Science Fantasy Publishers (third edition in 1991, updated annually), published by Mirage Press, Ltd,[2] a bibliographic guide to genre small press publishers which was a Hugo Award nominee in 1992. The Maryland young writers contest sponsored by the Baltimore Science Fiction Society was renamed &#34;&#39;The Jack L. Chalker Young Writers Contest&#34; effective April 8, 2006. ~~~ He is perhaps best known for his Well World series of novels, but he also wrote many other novels (most, but not all, part of series), and at least nine short stories. Many of his works involve some physical transformation of the main characters. For instance, in the Well World novels, immigrants to the Well World are transformed...</p><p>&#34;A Reader&#39;s Guide to Science Fiction&#34; has praised Jack L.

First-rate history grounded in scholarship and brought to life by a critically acclaimed author.<br><br>From breathless hagiographies to scandal-mongering expos�s, no family has generated more bestselling books than the Kennedys. None of them, however, has focused on the watershed period of World War II, when the course of the family and its individual members changed utterly. Now, in an engaging narrative grounded in impeccable scholarship, Edward J. Renehan, Jr., provides a dramatic portrait of years marked by family tensions, heartbreaks, and heroics. It was during this time that tragedy began to haunt the family&#x2013;Joe Jr.&#x2019;s death, the untimely widowhood of Kathleen (a.k.a. &#x201c;Kick&#x201d;), Rosemary&#x2019;s lobotomy. But it was also the time in which John F. Kennedy rose above the strictures of the clan and became his own man. <br><br>In the late 1930s, the Kennedys settled in London, where Joseph Kennedy, Sr., was serving as ambassador. A virulent anti-Semite and isolationist, Kennedy relentlessly and ruthlessly fought to keep America out of the war in Europe. His behavior as patriarch in many ways mirrored his public style. Though he was devoted to the family, he was also manipulative and autocratic. In re-creating the intense and tension-filled interactions among the family, Renehan offers riveting, often revisionist views of Joseph Sr.; heir apparent Joe Jr.; Kick, the beautiful socialite; and Jack, the complex charmer. He demonstrates that Joe Jr., although much like his father in opinion and character, was driven to volunteer for a deadly mission in large part because of his fury at Jack&#x2019;s seemingly easy successes. Renehan also delves into why Kick, a good Catholic girl, chose to abandon her religion for the chance to enter the fairytale world of the British aristocracy, only to suffer a horrendous tragedy.<br><br>It is Renehan&#x2019;s reassessment of Jack, however, that is particularly striking. In subtly breaking away from his domineering father over the issue of World War II, Renehan argues, Jack began to forge the character that would eventually take him to the Oval Office. Going behind the familiar (and accurate) image of JFK as a reckless playboy, Renehan shows us a young man of great intelligence, moral courage, and truly astonishing physical bravery.</p><p>Somebody once asked John F. Kennedy how he became a war hero. "It was easy," he replied. "They sank my boat." JFK's adventure aboard PT-109 in the Second World War is fairly well-known. Kennedy's boat did indeed sink in the Pacific, but it was his able leadership that helped his men survive in dangerous waters and then on a deserted island. This episode comprises only a sliver of Edward J. Renehan Jr.'s story of the Kennedy family at war. Father Joe Kennedy, who was FDR's isolationist ambassador to Great Britain, looms over much of the book, especially the first half. JFK's older brother, Joe Jr., was also involved in the war; when he died on a bombing raid, the family's political aspirations shifted onto Jack. (Sisters Kathleen and Rosemary also receive due attention.) Renehan provides a fascinating glimpse at how the central event of the 20th century shaped one of America's great dynasties. He disputes a few previous interpretations--he says JFK's book <i>Why England Slept</i> became a bestseller because of its merits rather than his father's eagerness to buy multiple copies. What emerges is a clear picture of the future president as a young man and a story of how a war changed him: He "looked at life and the world in a new and unique way, operating from a perspective he could not have previously imagined." <i>The Kennedys at War</i> is a welcome addition to a crowded field of Kennedy books and highly recommended for anybody interested in this fascinating family. <i>--John Miller</i>"Benefiting from the new information and hindsight, <i>The Kennedys at War</i> movingly captures the poignancy of America&#x2019;s most-talked-about family as they grapple with the difficult challenges of the Second World War. Reported with great integrity, this compelling saga deserves a wide readership. A truly first-rate study." &#x2013;Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies and professor of history at the University of New Orleans<br><br>"<i>The Kennedys at War</i> is a vivid group portrait of that perennially fascinating family during the tragedy-filled years that taught its members, as John F. Kennedy himself remembered, that there was &#x2018;nothing inevitable about us.&#x2019; The author&#x2019;s convincing portrayal of the future president as a substantive as well as sardonic young man should help to rescue his reputation from the damage done by the more irresponsible revisionists." <br> &#x2013;Geoffrey C.

Their serpentine journey takes them to an enclave of Manhattan they never imagined could exist: a secretive, reclusive cult of Obeah and vodou which no outsiders have ever survived.</p><p>Douglas Preston, a regular contributor to <em>The New Yorker</em>, worked for the American Museum of Natural History.

This one does not disappoint. Mysterious FBI agent Pendergast returns to solve the murder of NEW YORK TIMES reporter William Smithback, whose killer is plainly visible on a security camera. The only trouble is: The killer had died two weeks before the murder. Ren� Auberjonois, who played the alien Odo on &#34;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#34; and the grim Paul Lewiston on &#34;Boston Legal,&#34; lends the proper air of gravitas to his performance. With the underlying story featuring zombies and the undead, it takes the sober Auberjonois to help maintain the credibility of the plot. His sincere delivery is perfect for a strange story that is more than a little creepy.

Smith has pointed the academic study of religion in a new theoretical direction, one neither theological nor willfully ideological.<br><br>Making use of examples as apparently diverse and exotic as the Maori cults in nineteenth-century New Zealand and the events of Jonestown, Smith shows that religion must be construed as conventional, anthropological, historical, and as an exercise of imagination. In his analyses, religion emerges as the product of historically and geographically situated human ingenuity, cognition, and curiosity?simply put, as the result of human labor, one of the decisive but wholly ordinary ways human beings create the worlds in which they live and make sense of them.<br><br>"These seven essays . . . display the critical intelligence, creativity, and sheer common sense that make Smith one of the most methodologically sophisticated and suggestive historians of religion writing today. . . . Smith scrutinizes the fundamental problems of taxonomy and comparison in religious studies, suggestively redescribes such basic categories as canon and ritual, and shows how frequently studied myths may more likely reflect situational incongruities than vaunted mimetic congruities. His final essay, on Jonestown, demonstrates the interpretive power of the historian of religion to render intelligible that in our own day which seems most bizarre."?Richard S.

In my work we reckon that murder is most likely to happen among close acquaintances. Someone will finally snap after years of being wound up to blind rage by the very folk who best know how to drive them to distraction. For once it will be just too much to watch someone else eating the last sesame pancake&#x2014;which, of course, was snatched with a triumphant laugh that was intended to rankle. So a victim expires with honey still dribbling down their chin&#x2014;though it happens less often than you might expect.<br>Why are more kitchen cleavers not sunk between the fat shoulders of appalling uncles who get the slaves pregnant? Or that sneaky sister who shamelessly grabs the most desirable bedroom, with its glimpse of a corner of the Temple of Divine Claudius and almost no cracks in the walls? Or the crude son who farts uncontrollably, however many times he is told ...<br>Even if people do not stab or strangle their own, you would expect more to rush out into the streets and vent their frustration upon the first person they meet. Perhaps they do. Perhaps even the random killing of strangers, which the vigiles call &#x2018;a motiveless crime&#x2019;, sometimes has an understandable domestic cause.<br>_______<br>It could so easily have happened to us.<br>I grew up in a large family, crammed into a couple of small, sour rooms. All around our apartment were other teeming groups, too noisy, too obstreperous and all packed together far too close. Perhaps the thing that saved us from tragedy was that my father left home&#x2014;his only escape from a situation he had come to find hideous, and an event which at least saved us from the burden of more children. Later my brother took himself off to the army; eventually I saw the sense of it and did the same. My sisters moved out to harass the feckless men they bullied into marriage. My mother, having brought up seven, was left alone but continued to have a strong influence on all of us. Even my father, once he returned to Rome, viewed Ma with wary respect.<br>As she continually reminded us, mothers can never retire. So, when my wife went into labour with our third child, in came Ma to boss everyone about, even though she was becoming frail and had eyesight problems. Helena&#x2019;s own mama rushed to our house too, the noble Julia Justa rolling up her sleeves to interfere in her genteel way. We had employed a perfectly decent midwife.<br>At first the mothers battled for dominance. In the end, when they were both badly needed, all that stopped.<br>My new son died on the day he was born. At once, we felt we were living in a tragedy that was unique to us. I suppose that is how it always seems.<br>The birth had been easy, a short labour like our second daughter&#x2019;s. Favonia had taken a week to seize upon existence but then she thrived. I thought the same would happen. But when this baby emerged, he was already fading. He never responded to us; he slipped away within hours.<br>The midwife said a mother should hold a dead baby; afterwards she and Julia Justa had to wrestle to make Helena give up the body again. Helena went into deep shock. Women cleaned up, as they do. Helena Justina stayed in the bedroom, refusing comfort, ignoring food, declining to see her daughters, even distant with me. My sister Maia said this day would be black in Helena&#x2019;s calendar for the rest of her life; Maia knew what it was to lose a child. At first I could not believe Helena would ever come out of it. It seemed to me, we might never even reach that point where grief only overtook her on anniversaries. She stayed frozen at the moment when she was told her boy was dead.<br>All action fell to me. It was not a legal necessity, but I named him: Marcus Didius Justinianus. In my place many fathers would not have bothered. His birth would not be registered; he had no civic identity. Perhaps I was wrong. I just had to decide what to do. His mother had survived, but for the moment I was alone trying to hold the family together, trying to choose what formalities were appropriate. It all became even more difficult after I learned what else had happened on that day.<br>The tiny swaddled bundle had been placed in a room we rarely used. What was I to do next? A newborn should receive no funeral rites; he was too small for full cremation. Adult burials must be held outside the city; families who can afford it build a mausoleum beside a highroad for their embalmed bodies or cremation urns. That had never been for us; ashes of the plebeian Didii are kept in a cupboard for a time, and then mysteriously lost.<br>My mother revealed that she had always taken her stillborns to the Campagna farm where she grew up, but I could not leave my distraught family. Helena&#x2019;s father, the senator, offered me a niche in the tumbledown columbarium of the Camilli on the Via Appia, saying sadly, &#x2018;It will be a very small urn!&#x2019; I thought about it, but was too proud. We live in a patriarchal society; he was my son. I don&#x2019;t give two figs for formal rules, but disposal was my responsibility.<br>Some people inter newborn babies under a slab in a new building; none was available and I jibbed at making our child into a votive offering. I don&#x2019;t annoy the gods; I don&#x2019;t encourage them either. We lived in an old town house at the foot of the Aventine, with a back exit, but almost no ground. If I dug a tiny grave among the sage and rosemary, there was a horrendous possibility children at play or cooks digging holes to bury fish bones might one day turn up little Marcus&#x2019; ribs accidentally.<br>I climbed up to our roof terrace and sat alone with the problem.<br>The answer came to me just before stiffness set in. I would take my sad bundle out to my father&#x2019;s house. We ourselves had once lived there, up on the Janiculan Hill across the Tiber; in fact, I was the idiot who first bought the inconvenient place. I had since worked a swap with my father but it still seemed like home. Although Pa was a reprobate, his villa offered the baby a resting place where, when Helena was ready for it, we could put up a memorial stone.<br>I wondered briefly why my father had not yet come with condolences. Normally when people wanted time alone, he was a first-footer. He could smell tragedy like newly cooked bread. He was bound to let himself in with that house key he would never give back to me, then irritate us with his insensitivity. The thought of Pa issuing platitudes to shake Helena out of her sadness was dire. He would probably try to get me drunk. Wine was bound to feature in my recovery one day, but I wanted to choose how, when and where the medicine was applied. The dose would be poured by my best friend Petronius Longus. The only reason I had not sought him out so far, was delicacy because he too had lost young children. Besides, I had things to do first.<br>My mother was staying at our house. She would continue to do so, as long as she believed she was needed. Perhaps that would be longer than we really wanted, but Ma would do what she thought best.<br>Helena wanted no part in the funeral. She turned away, weeping, when I told her what I planned to do. I hoped she approved. I hoped she knew that dealing with this was the only way I could try to help her. Albia, our teenaged foster daughter, intended to accompany me but in the end even she was too upset. Ma might have made the pilgrimage but I gratefully left her to look after little Julia and Favonia. I would not ask her to see Pa, from whom she had been bitterly estranged for thirty years. If I had asked, she might have forced herself to come and support me, but I had enough to endure without that worry.<br>So I went alone. And I was alone, therefore, when the subdued slaves at my father&#x2019;s house told me the next piece of bad news. On the same day that I lost my son, I lost my father too.<br>Excerpted from Nemesis by Lindsey Davis.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Lindsey Davis.<br>Published in September 2010 by Minotaur Books.<br>All rights reserved.

In this thrilling narrative, John Rees brings to life the men&#x2014;including John Lilburne, Richard Overton and Thomas Rainsborough&#x2014;and women who ensured victory and became an inspiration to republicans of many nations.<br><br>From the raucous streets of London and the clattering printers&#x2019; workshops that stoked the uprising, to the rank and file of the New Model Army and the furious Putney debates where the Levellers argued with Oliver Cromwell for the future of English democracy, this story reasserts the revolutionary nature of the 1642&#x2013;51 wars and the role of ordinary people in this pivotal moment in history.<br><br>In particular Rees places the Levellers at the centre of the debates of 1647 when the nation was gripped by the question of what to do with the defeated Charles I.

Her characters are heroic in ordinary ways - they talk, laugh, and think about the things that matter to them. They live normal, everyday lives yet remain awake and focused in their concern about the future, emanating wisdom, humor, disappointment, hope, and fear. These stories center upon an appropriately named character, Faith, who tells and listens to the stories of friends, neighbors, lovers, and strangers struggling to find hope and meaning in their sometimes shattered lives. As the story titles suggest, Faith's endless confidence in her friends and in the ordinary powers of "Listening" and in becoming a "Story Hearer" pave the way for radical transformation. In "Zagrowsky Tells," Faith runs into the old Jewish pharmacist whose drug store she and her friends once picketed because he refused to sell to black patrons. Now, years later, she listens to how the ordinary act of learning to love his half black, half-Jewish grandson has taught him to unlearn his racism. Throughout the collection, neighbors learn to listen to each other, husbands and lovers learn to hear women, women who are longtime friends and political allies validate each others lives, and strangers tell stories that need to be heard. For Grace Paley, these important ties of love, faith, and language are what create community. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Suzanne Sowinska</i>In the 17 short stories collected here, Paley writes with verbal economy and resonance, pithy insights, and warmth and humor.

The main thread of the book is the exploration of the Qliphoth and the dark mysteries which have for so long been a repressed part of western esotericism. Instead of ignoring and denying the dark side, the author reveals, step by step, how man can get to know his Shadow and, through this, reach a deeper knowledge of the Self. By exploring and not by repressing the Shadow it can be transformed from a destructive force into a creative power. The book deals with the problem of evil, the symbolism behind the fall of Lucifer and mans creation process according to Qabalistic philosophy. The theories that are presented in this book are also linked to practice. Several examples of rituals, meditations, magical exercises and occult correspondences can be found within. Qabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic contains more than one hundred demonic sigils and pieces of art that were created specifically for this book. A unique collection of all the sigils from the classic grimoires Lemegeton: The Lesser Key of Solomon and the infamous Grimorium Verum are also included.</p><p>Thomas Karlsson has studied and practiced the occult sciences for more than fifteen years and is the founder of the esoteric order Dragon Rouge.

Kennedy's assassination to the media, has authored a behind-the-scenes account that chronicles the tragedy and its fifty-year legacy. In <i>JFK's Final Hours in Texas</i>, Read documents not only the immediate agony endured by the people in the epicenter of the tragedy but also the continuing experience of a wounded community recovering from its aftermath. In 1963, Read was the media representative for Governor John B. Connally, host of the president's November visit to Texas. On the day Kennedy was killed, Read was aboard the chartered White House Press bus, just a few vehicles behind the presidential limousine in the motorcade through downtown Dallas. After hearing the shots and watching the limousine lurch forward amid panicking onlookers, Read raced to nearby Parkland Hospital, where the president and Connally had been rushed to emergency rooms. There, immediately after White House Deputy Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff announced that the president was dead, Read briefed journalists based on what Nellie Connally, wife of the governor, had hurriedly reported to him. Beyond capturing the drama of the immediate hours following the assassination, Read illuminates the previously overlooked consequences of the aborted portion of the trip. The author also traces the long aftermath of the assassination, including the intensity of the bitterness against Dallas and Texas. And, in what he calls "the long journey from anguish to reconciliation," Read follows the decades-long struggle to create the Sixth Floor Museum in downtown Dallas, located in the space where Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shots.</p><p>Julian Read is a nationally prominent Texan corporate communications and public affairs counselor who has been part of the state's business and political scene for more than half a century.

Based in Austin, Read continues to provide senior counsel for Cohn &amp; Wolfe, a worldwide unit of London-based WPP.</p><h2>The Last Englishman: The Double Life of Arthur Ransome</h2><p>Arthur Ransome is best known for the twelve immortal ''Swallows and Amazons'' books he wrote on his return from Russia in 1928. From his prose he appears a genial and gentle Englishman, who, like his protagonists, pursued benign maritime adventures. Nothing could be further from the truth. By the time he wrote his masterpieces, the most interesting episodes of his life were well behind him. For Ransome led a double, and often tortured, life. Before his fame as an author, he was notorious for very different reasons: between 1917 and 1924, he was the Russian correspondent for the Daily News and the Manchester Guardian, and his sympathy for the Bolshevik regime gave him unparalleled access to its leaders, policies, politics, and plots. He was also the lover, and later the husband, of Evgenia Shelepina, Trotsky's private secretary, as well as friends with Karl Radek, the Bolshevik's Chief of Propaganda, and Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the secret police. In denying the horrors that followed the Revolution, and in considering Stalin a latter-day Cromwell, he was the bane of the British establishment. Yet his contacts earned him not only the admiration of liberals, both in the U.K. and the U.S., but a place in the British Secret Intelligence Service.<br><br>In this biography, Chambers traces Ransome's life back to his earliest childhood, his struggles as a hack writer, and his flight from a disastrous marriage, then on to the decade he spent in Russia during that country's violent, formative years, ostensibly as a journalist, but more accurately as a spy (albeit a sympathetic one). The book's genius lies in Chambers's complete understanding of the Revolution's complexity, the rise and fall of the factions, the extreme personalities who guided it and were often sacrificed to it. He explores the tensions Ransome always felt between his allegiance to England's decencies and the egalitarian Bolshevik vision, between competing romantic attachments, between the Lake Country he loved and always considered home and the lure of the Russian steppes to which he repeatedly returned. What emerges is not only history, recorded by someone who was there to witness it, but also the story of an immensely troubled and conflicted human being not entirely at home in either culture or country.<br><br>Winner of the Biographers' Club Best First Biography Prize, 2009</p><p>Roland Chambers is a biographer and children&#39;s book author. He divides his time between London and Connecticut.This sturdy biography contains some surprises for those readers who know Ransome (1884&#x2013;1967) as the author of the Swallows and Amazons series of children&#x2019;s books. As it turns out, Ransome was also a political journalist, a spy for the British SIS, and an outspoken defender of the Russian Revolution&#x2014;all of this before he wrote the gentle children&#x2019;s stories with which he is most closely associated. This is one of those biographies that succeeds on the strength of its story rather than on the liveliness of its writing, which is staid and scholarly. But the life itself is so compelling, and so unexpectedly full of intrigue, that we are kept, if not spellbound, at least too interested to put the book down. Ransome scholars and fans of the children&#x2019;s series will be drawn to the book, of course, but it will also prove satisfying to readers with an interest in the period surrounding the Russian Revolution. Like American journalist John Reed, Ransome witnessed the upheaval from the inside, not merely as an observer of events but as an involved participant. --David Pitt</p><h2>Lincoln (Modern Library)</h2><p>Lincoln is the cornerstone of Gore Vidal's fictional American chronicle, which includes Burr, 1876, Washington, D.C., Empire, and Hollywood. It opens early on a frozen winter morning in 1861, when President-elect Abraham Lincoln slips into Washington, flanked by two bodyguards. The future president is in disguise, for there is talk of a plot to murder him. During the next four years there will be numerous plots to murder this man who has sworn to unite a disintegrating nation. Isolated in a ramshackle White House in the center of a proslavery city, Lincoln presides over a fragmenting government as Lee's armies beat at the gates. In this profoundly moving novel, a work of epic proportions and intense human sympathy, Lincoln is observed by his loved ones and his rivals. The cast of characters is almost Dickensian: politicians, generals, White House aides, newspapermen, Northern and Southern conspirators, amiably evil bankers, and a wife slowly going mad. Vidal's portrait of the president is at once intimate <br>and monumental, stark and complex, drawn with the wit, grace, and authority of one of the great historical novelists.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With a new Introduction by the author.</p><p><i>Lincoln</i> is a masterwork of historical fiction, in which Gore Vidal combines a comprehensive knowledge of Civil War America with 20th-century literary technique, probing the minds and motives of the men surrounding Abraham Lincoln, including personal secretary John Hay and scheming cabinet members William Seward and Salmon P. Chase, as well as his wife, Mary Todd. It is a book monumental in scope that never loses sight of the intimate and personal in its depiction of the power struggles that accompanied Lincoln's efforts to preserve the Union at all costs--efforts in which the eradication of slavery was far from the president's main objective. As usual, there's plenty of room for Vidal's wickedly humorous deflation of American icons, including a comic interlude in a Washington bordello in which Lincoln's former law partner informs Hay that Lincoln had contracted syphilis as a young man and had, just before marrying Mary Todd, suffered what can only be described as a nervous breakdown. (Protestors should note that Vidal is only passing along what that former partner had written in his own biography of Lincoln.) Don't be intimidated by the size of <i>Lincoln</i>; if you like historical fiction, you should read this book at the first opportunity. <i>--Ron Hogan</i>"Superb . . . a grand entertainment. . . . A plausible and human Lincoln, of us and yet beyond us." --Harold Bloom<br><br>"A portrait of America's great president that is at once intimate and public, stark and complex, and that will become for future generations the living Lincoln, the definitive Lincoln. . . . Richly entertaining . . . history lessons with the blood still hot." --The Washington Post<br><br>"[Lincoln] is in Vidal's version at once more complex, mysterious and enigmatic, more implacably courageous and, finally, more tragic than the conventional images, the marble man of the memorial.

While working as a librarian, he began using catalogue cards to write sequential texts. He described his "note-card poems," as a "hybrid genre" that "slides along the edges of genres and, like a small mirror, fleetingly reflects each of them, without identifying with any of them." His work was circulated through samizdat and underground readings in the "unofficial" art scene of the sixties and seventies, finding wide publication only after the late 1980s.

Conant: Harvard to Hiroshima and the Making of the Nuclear Age</h2><p>James B. Conant was one of the giants of the American establishment. In this monumental biography, the first ever written, James G. Hershberg gives us the life of the renowned educator and scientist who led the U.S. government's effort to develop weapons of mass destruction, and whose own story mirrors America's transition from isolationism to global superpower at the dawn of the nuclear age.<br>Here is the full scope of Conant's astonishing life. Born in a working-class suburb of Boston, he demonstrated a remarkable aptitude in science that won him the chance to study chemistry at Harvard, where academic distinction led to a professorship. Then, in 1933, when this son of a photoengraver seemed a likely prospect for a Nobel Prize, Conant tearfully left his laboratory to assume the presidency of Harvard, the pinnacle of American education. It was during his tenure as president that his life took an even more amazing turn: in 1941, as science adviser to FDR, he was given the secret assignment of determining whether or not the atomic bomb could or should be built. Drawn out of the secure confines of the university, Conant entered public life at one of the most tumultuous and uncertain moments in American history and remained, for the next dozen years, among a handful of government advisers intimately involved in the decisions relating to nuclear weapons. He administered the Manhattan Project and witnessed the July 1945 Trinity test at Alamogordo, New Mexico, where for a horrifying instant he believed the world was literally coming to an end before his eyes; and that same summer, while serving on a secret panel, it was Conant who made the fateful recommendation to use the new weapon, without warning, on a Japanese city. Finally, in 1952, he left the "bad business" of nuclear policy-making after he and J. Robert Oppenheimer lost a bitter fight to prevent the building of the hydrogen bomb.<br>Thereafter, in public and in private, Conant wrestled with the terrible implications of the power he had taken part in unleashing, never to erase the terrifying awareness that he had helped humanity usher into existence the means of its own annihilation. Yet his fear of nuclear catastrophe did not prevent him from becoming one of the first of the Cold War warriors, an advocate of stern military measures and global interventionism aimed at protecting the postwar order from Communism. And when McCarthyism threatened American universities, Conant struggled to balance the supposedly conflicting imperatives of academic freedom and national security. As Eisenhower's representative in Germany during the mid-1950s he swallowed private doubts and oversaw the rearmament of that nation - whose menace had impelled the development of the bomb only a decade earlier - against a new enemy: the Soviet Union.<br>Integrating a wealth of previously classified information with original research, this penetrating and compellingly written biography illuminates a deeply enigmatic and pivotal figure who was a key force in shaping U.S. nuclear, scientific, foreign, and educational policies for almost half a century. James B. Conant peels back layers of government and institutional secrecy and the personal reticence of its subject to reveal the life and times of an exceptional man who achieved much, at great personal cost, and whose career - its accomplishments, limitations, and failures - helped define the American century.</p><p>&#x201c;This splendid portrait of Conant . . . illuminates the life of a pivotal figure in the making of U.S. nuclear, scientific, educational, and foreign policy for almost half a century. But the book is much more: it is not only an insightful narration of Conant&#x2019;s life, it is also a brilliant and important account of the making of the nuclear age, a chronicle that contains much that is new.&#x201d;&#x2014;Washington Post<br>&#x201c;The bomb would be as much Conant&#x2019;s as it was anyone&#x2019;s in government.

To make matters worse, it appears the late Greville may have led a less than savory personal life.<br><br>Unless Thomas Pitt and his wife, Charlotte, can root out the truth, simmering hatreds and passions may again explode in murder, the home rule movement may collapse, and civil war may destroy all of Ireland. . . .</p><p>Longtime readers of Anne Perry will be familiar with Inspector Thomas Pitt, the low-born London copper with a better-born wife, Charlotte. Set during the Victorian era, Perry's mysteries usually examine the dark underbelly of aristocratic life. Homosexuality, adultery, and pedophilia have all been subjects of her previous books; in <i>Ashworth Hall</i> she injects a new ingredient: politics. <p> Ashworth Hall is the name of an estate where, in the autumn of 1890, a highly secret meeting is being held to discuss Anglo-Irish relations. The "Irish Problem" soon takes a backseat to murder, however, and Inspector Pitt, who as the son of servants grew up on just such an estate, is called in to solve the case. While he investigates below-stairs, Charlotte gathers clues above. As usual, their collaboration is successful, both in crime-solving and as literature.</p>"DEADLY INTRIGUES . . .

Establishing a Palestinian state, so the thinking goes, would be a panacea for all the region&#x2019;s ills.&nbsp;In a time of partisan gridlock, the two-state solution stands out for its ability to attract supporters from both sides of America's ideological divide. But the great irony is that it is one of the most irrational and failed policies the United States has ever adopted.<br><br> Between 1970 and 2013, the United States presented nine different peace plans for Israel and the Palestinians, and for the past twenty years, the two state solution has been the centerpiece of U.S. Middle East policy. But despite this laser focus, American efforts to implement a two-state peace deal have failed&#x2014;and with each new attempt, the Middle East has become less stable, more violent, more radicalized, and more inimical to democratic values and interests.&nbsp; <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>The Israeli Solution</i>, Caroline Glick, senior contributing editor to the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, examines the history and misconceptions behind the two-state policy, most notably:<br><br>- The huge errors made in counting the actual numbers of Jews and Arabs in the region. The 1997 Palestinian Census, upon which most two-state policy is based, wildly exaggerated the numbers of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza.<br><br>- Neglect of the long history of Palestinian anti-Semitism, refusal to negotiate in good faith, terrorism, and denial of Israel&#x2019;s right to exist.<br><br>- Disregard for Israel&#x2019;s stronger claims to territorial sovereignty under international law, as well as the long history of Jewish presence in the region.<br><br>- Indifference to polling data that shows the Palestinian people admire Israeli society and governance. Despite a half-century of domestic and international terrorism, anti-semitism, and military attacks from regional neighbors who reject its right to exist, Israel has thrived as the Middle East&#x2019;s lone democracy.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a century spent chasing a two-state policy that hasn&#x2019;t brought the Israelis and Palestinians any closer to peace, <i>The Israeli Solution</i> offers an alternative path to stability in the Middle East based on Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.</p><p><b>CAROLINE GLICK&nbsp; </b>is the senior contributing editor to the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, where she writes two weekly syndicated columns.

The depot was located on the northern outskirts of Tel Aviv, adjacent to Ramat Hasharon, and Herzliya, which put it in the middle of the most densely populated area in the Western world.1<br><br>At seven a.m. Ginsburg passed through the security checkpoint, entered the depot, and began fueling. Suddenly the ground began to shake beneath him. &#x201c;There was a massive boom,&#x201d; he later told reporters. &#x201c;Everyone went flying in all directions, and the tanker, which weighs twenty tons, just exploded in the air. Everything was burning and going up in flames. Miraculously nothing happened to me. I thought it was an electrical malfunction. It never occurred to me that it was a terrorist attack.&#x201d;2<br><br>But it was. Palestinian terrorists had placed a bomb in Ginsburg&#x2019;s fuel tank. A cell member had followed Ginsburg to Pi Gelilot, waited for him to begin fueling, and remotely detonated the bomb.<br><br>The only reason Pi Gelilot is not remembered as the most deadly terror attack in history is because Ginsburg&#x2019;s tanker carried diesel fuel.3 Had it been carrying gasoline, which is much more flammable than diesel, not only would the entire facility have been destroyed, but the fireball created by the explosion would have engulfed neighboring communities. Tel Aviv&#x2019;s tony Ramat Aviv neighborhood, home to 11,400 people, would likely have been reduced to a smoldering ruin. So would Ramat Hasharon and Herzliya, which have a combined population of 127,600.<br><br>And that wouldn&#x2019;t have been the end of it. Pi Gelilot is also located next to one of Israel&#x2019;s busiest traffic arteries, as well as the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel&#x2019;s foreign intelligence service, and of Israeli Military Intelligence. The Israel Security Agency, Israel&#x2019;s version of the FBI, is located nearby. Had the bomb worked as the Palestinian terrorists planned, the highway would have become a fireball at the height of rush hour, and Israel&#x2019;s intelligence nerve centers would have been leveled.<br><br>The attack at Pi Gelilot took place the morning after a suicide bombing at a pedestrian mall in downtown Rishon Lezion, a bustling coastal city due south of Tel Aviv. In the month that followed the attack, another sixty-five Israelis were murdered, including fifteen children, in Palestinian terrorist attacks of every sort carried out from one end of the country to the other. Adjusting for Israel&#x2019;s relatively small population, this would have been the equivalent of 2,600 Americans being killed.<br><br>More than 90 percent of the attacks that month were directed against civilian targets. Less than 10 percent of the dead and less than 5 percent of the wounded were Israeli military forces engaged in counterterror operations.4 Teenage boys were gunned down at a basketball court. A grandmother and her infant granddaughter were blown up at an ice cream parlor. Another grandmother and her five-year-old granddaughter were blown up, along with five other people, at a bus stop. Two families were massacred in their homes, and a fourteen-year-old girl was murdered at a falafel stand.<br><br>The perpetrators of these attacks came from almost every active Palestinian terror group. Most were Fatah terrorists. <br><br>Fatah is the largest faction of the PLO. It was founded by Yassir Arafat in 1957 and the leaders of the PLO-controlled Palestinian Authority are overwhelmingly members of Fatah. The Fatah terror cells that perpetrated most of the terrorist operations were directed and funded by the Palestinian Authority. <br><br>Others attacks were carried out by Hamas and Islamic Jihad cells. Some of the terrorists served more than one master. <br><br>In perpetrating these attacks, terror groups openly collaborated with one another. Some of the attacks were carried out jointly by terrorists from different groups. For instance, a terror cell with members from Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine massacred forty-year-old Rachel Shabo and her sons, sixteen-year-old Neria, twelve-year-old Zvika, and five-year-old Avishai in their home.5<br><br>This sort of mayhem is what passed for everyday life in Israel on June 24, 2002, when in a much-anticipated speech, President George W. Bush set out his position on the Palestinian conflict with Israel.6<br><br>Until that date, Bush had kept his position to himself. Warring factions within his administration competed over which narrative the president would advance. The establishmentarians, led by Secretary of State Colin Powell, wanted the United States to pressure Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians. The renegade hawks in the Defense Department and on Vice President Dick Cheney&#x2019;s staff wanted the United States to put pressure on the Palestinians and side openly with Israel in its war on the Palestinian terror wave that had engulfed the country. In the days leading up to President Bush&#x2019;s speech, the international community was abuzz with anticipation that America&#x2019;s commander in chief was finally ready to choose which side he was on.<br><br>To a certain degree, Bush lived up to those expectations. In that speech, he became the first U.S. leader since the onset of the peace process between Israel and the PLO in September 1993 to tell the Palestinians to get their house in order. Other American leaders had called for the Palestinians to fight terrorism, but Bush told them to stop sponsoring it. Moreover, he seemed to express that U.S. support for the Palestinians depended on a change in their behavior. &#x201c;Today, Palestinian authorities are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is unacceptable. And the United States will not support the establishment of a Palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure.&#x201d;<br><br>Bush also spelled out what he meant by Palestinian political reform. In his words, &#x201c;Reform must be more than cosmetic change, or a veiled attempt to preserve the status quo. True reform will require entirely new political and economic institutions, based on democracy, market economics, and action against terrorism.&#x201d;<br><br>Bush&#x2019;s words were like an adrenaline shot for the beleaguered Israeli citizenry. Not only had the president of the United States recognized that they were the victims of unrelenting terrorist assaults; he recognized that Israel&#x2019;s very right to exist was under attack. From the Arab world to Europe to U.S. university campuses, Israel was under the gun of hateful propaganda. Its army was being falsely and maliciously accused of committing the same very crimes that the Palestinians were carrying out against Israelis. Its leaders and generals were being targeted by scurrilous war-crimes allegations in European courts. And now here was Bush, the leader of the free world, pledging to put an end to this nonsense.<br><br>Unfortunately, a closer--and less emotional--reading of Bush&#x2019;s speech shows that there was less to the speech than met the eye. While the tone was indeed pro-Israel, Bush later acknowledged in his memoir that it was actually the most pro-Palestinian speech that any U.S. president had ever given.7 It was the first time an American president openly embraced the cause of Palestinian statehood. Moreover, while Bush did call the Palestinians to account for their involvement in terrorism against Israel, he didn&#x2019;t give them an ultimatum. He didn&#x2019;t say, Clean up your act or sacrifice U.S. support. He said, Clean up your act and get even more support.<br><br>And he also blamed Israel for Palestinian misery. Indeed, every time Bush spoke of Israeli suffering, he matched that statement with one about Palestinian suffering. This pattern began at the outset of the address as he said, &#x201c;It is untenable for Israeli citizens to live in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation.&#x201d;<br><br>Three months before Bush&#x2019;s speech, in April 2002, nearly a year and a half into the Palestinians&#x2019; terror war, Israel&#x2019;s government had finally ordered the IDF to destroy the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure in Judea and Samaria. This involved reasserting Israeli security control of the Palestinian towns and villages that Israel, in the framework of the peace process, had ceded to the Palestinian Authority in 1994 and 1996.8 Israel called its campaign Operation Defensive Shield. It came after a month in which the Palestinians carried out suicide bombings against Israeli civilians nearly every day. One hundred thirty people--nearly all civilians--were murdered. More than a thousand people were wounded, in a country of only 8 million people. In terms relative to Israel&#x2019;s overall population, the death toll in Israel was nearly as large as two September 11 terror attacks in the United States, but attacks in which the number of dead would be supplemented by more than 40,000 wounded.<br><br>Israel needed to reassert its security control of the Palestinian population centers because the Palestinian Authority had used its control of these areas to build not the institutions of a functional state but rather the most widespread and sophisticated terrorist infrastructure in the world.9 After Israeli forces retook control, it required months for them to dismantle this architecture of terror.<br><br>From documents found in Yassir Arafat&#x2019;s headquarters in Ramallah, Israel discovered that Arafat had personally overseen the development of this terror machine. He had paid for attacks, and his lieutenants had played central roles in organizing and carrying them out.10<br><br>And yet despite everything that Israel--and the United States--had learned about the central role the Palestinian Authority played in Palestinian terrorism, Bush insisted in his June 24 speech that &#x201c;as we make progress towards security, Israeli forces need to withdraw fully to the positions they held prior to September 28, 2000.&#x201d; In other words, he called for Israel to return control of these territories to the very PLO regime that had used its control of them to organize, plan, train, and finance the largest terror campaign against Israel that the Jewish state had ever experienced.<br><br>And that wasn&#x2019;t all. Bush also sided completely with the Palestinian narrative against Israel. That narrative claims that Israel has no rights to Judea and Samaria and that those areas belong to the Palestinians alone. Bush said, &#x201c;Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop.&#x201d; That is, the U.S. president said that the property rights of Israeli citizens should not be respected in Judea and Samaria.<br><br>Less than a year later, on April 30, 2003, the Bush administration joined forces with the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations (a grouping that came to be known as the Middle East Quartet) and published a new &#x201c;peace plan.&#x201d; The plan, officially called &#x201c;A Performance-Based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,&#x201d; effectively nullified Bush&#x2019;s call for Palestinian reform as a precursor to and condition for U.S. support for Palestinian statehood. The roadmap identified the principal goal of the U.S. government as the swift establishment of a Palestinian state, rather than the purging of terrorist elements from Palestinian society and governing structures. It reduced the requirement for Palestinian reform to mere declaratory phrases.<br><br>On the other hand, the roadmap required Israel to immediately renounce its rights to Judea and Samaria and take concrete measures to empower the same Palestinian Authority that was actively sponsoring the murder of Israel&#x2019;s citizens. The only aspects of Bush&#x2019;s June 24 speech that found their way into the roadmap were those involving Israeli concessions to the Palestinians.11<br><br>The inherent anti-Israel bias of the roadmap is nowhere more obvious than in its section on Palestinian incitement.<br><br>Since the inception of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, the PA-controlled media organs, school system, mosques, and governing ministries have carried out a massive, systematic campaign of incitement against Israelis. These institutions do not call for Israel&#x2019;s return to the 1949 armistice lines: they call for Israel&#x2019;s complete destruction. And they do not portray Israelis merely as citizens of an enemy state: they portray Israelis and Jews as satanic monsters, subhuman enemies of Allah. This campaign of incitement--which continues to this day--has encouraged Palestinians to make the destruction of Israel and the genocide of the Jewish people their highest goals in life.12<br><br>By the last year of Bush&#x2019;s second term in office, even his most enthusiastic Israeli supporters were unable to believe he was serious about his demand that the Palestinians reform their society and system of government or about making U.S. support for Palestinian statehood conditional on the implementation of such reform.<br><br>In 2005 Bush publicly credited Natan Sharansky--the former Soviet dissident, human rights activist, and political prisoner, turned Israeli politician, turned political theorist--with inspiring him to view the democratization of Palestinian and pan-Arab governance as the foundation for lasting peace and security in the Middle East.13 For his part, Sharansky was one of Bush&#x2019;s most enthusiastic supporters and defenders in Israel and the United States.<br><br>But in early 2008 Sharansky broke publicly with Bush, accusing him of abandoning the freedom agenda. In an op-ed (coauthored with Palestinian human rights activist Bassam Eid) titled &#x201c;Bush&#x2019;s Mideast U-Turn,&#x201d; he wrote:<br><br>The real breakthrough of Mr. Bush&#x2019;s vision five-and-a-half years ago was not his call for a two-state solution or even the call for Palestinians to &#x201c;choose leaders not compromised by terror.&#x201d; Rather, the breakthrough was in making peace conditional on a fundamental transformation of Palestinian society. . . . <br><br>But the past few years have shown that when it comes to dealing with Israelis and Palestinians, the vital link between freedom and peace is almost entirely ignored. . . .<br>1.

Kreider's vision of the human condition is of a man distracted from the vast starship hovering over his city by a glimpse of a pretty girl's ass; his version of the existential abyss is a cruddy Laundromat; and the only hope or joy he finds in this life is in jigglin' dem monster juggs or setting a monkey's ass on fire.

Charles Dickens called Thaxter&#x2019;s essays &#x201c;admirable&#x201d; and Horace Greeley declared, &#x201c;The best prose writing I have seen for a long time is Mrs. Thaxter&#x2019;s &#x2018;Isles of Shoals&#x2019; in the Atlantic. Her pen-pictures are wonderfully well-done.&#x201d; Published as a book in 1873, Among the Isles of Shoals remained equally popular, printed not only in hardcover but also in a fifty-cent guidebook edition which was sold in railway stations. Now generally considered to be Thaxter&#x2019;s masterpiece, Among the Isles of Shoals is available once again in this new edition. Thaxter herself was raised on the Isles of Shoals, a group of nine small, rocky islands off the coast of New Hampshire, and she lived there off and on for much of her life. This lyrical volume seamlessly blends natural history, oral tradition, and personal observation to create a work that one critic says feels &#x201c;somehow distilled from the islands themselves.&#x201d; The bleak landscape of the Isles of Shoals has changed little since the time that Thaxter wrote this tribute, but as the Hartford Courant noted upon its original publication, &#x201c;whether the traveler goes to these isles or not, if he has this little volume in his pocket, wherever he is he will have a most charming companion.&#x201d;</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 16 illus.CELIA LAIGHTON THAXTER(1835&#x2013;1894) was one of the most popular poets of the late nineteenth century and a leading literary figure who counted among her friends such writers as John Greenleaf Whittier, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.

Yahweh Ben Yahweh--a self-proclaimed messiah, chronicles his creation of a multimillion-dollar empire and the crimes that have left him serving time in federal prison. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>A gripping yet somewhat unsatisfying account of one of America's weirder stories: the saga of Yahweh Ben Yahweh (God Son of God), the Miami-based charismatic black man who called himself the Messiah. Freedberg, who won a 1991 Pulitzer Prize for her Miami Herald coverage of Yahweh, reconstructs events in an animated narrative. Hulon Mitchell Jr., born in Oklahoma in 1935, led many lives: gung- ho Air Force man; NAACP supporter; Black Muslim proselytizer; Atlanta radio evangelist; and Orlando street preacher. In 1978, he moved to Miami and launched a new religion that boosted black identity, denigrated whites, and declared that a journey to a Promised Land was near. He built a headquarters for the group (whose many names included the Nation of Israel and the Tribe of Judah) in riot-scarred Liberty City, where his turbaned, white- robed followers not only proselytized and sold taped sermons and food, but also contributed tithes and welfare checks. Laggards were punished and critics beaten, one even killed in the group's Temple of Love. Meanwhile, Yahweh's followers won favor with local politicians, manipulated the media, and gained a reputation as a group that could reclaim ghetto real estate. Then, one month after Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez had proclaimed Yahweh Ben Yahweh Day in 1990, the FBI swooped in to arrest Yahweh and several followers. A bizarre and complex trial led to the convictions of Yahweh and some of those charged with him for conspiracy involving various acts of violence (Yahweh got 18 years); but Yahweh beat three state murder raps. Though Freedberg scores the justice system for not addressing the political corruption that accommodated Yahweh and his personality cult, she does too little to explain the sect's appeal to blacks or to question the coddling posture of establishment institutions toward Yahweh (or her own newspaper's delay in picking up on the story). Good on the trees, but not enough forest. (b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In an amazing feat of investigative reporting, Freedberg relates the bizarre saga of the Temple of Love (aka the Hebrew Israelites), a Miami-based sect founded in the late 1970s by Oklahoma-born evangelist-messiah Hulon Mitchell Jr., whose followers proclaimed him the savior of black people. To his supporters, Mitchell-now in prison on a 1992 conspiracy conviction; he will be released in 2001 and eligible for parole earlier-is a positive force who taught African Americans self-empowerment. But media and police accounts link his organization to a series of brutal murders, and testimony at his dramatic trial (which deadlocked on a racketeering charge of murder, arson and extortion) portrayed a cruel cult rife with mind control, assaults and slave labor. Mitchell, who calls himself Yahweh Ben Yahweh ("God, Son of God") also beat three murder raps when Florida state attorney Janet Reno (now U.S. Attorney General) lost one death-row case against him and dropped charges on two other homicides. Freedberg, who won a 1991 Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of this story for the Miami Herald, tells a searing cautionary tale of a man who used race and religion as a shield to exploit people and amass power and wealth.

But this long and winding road has produced nothing like Baby You're a Rich Man, the first book devoted to the cascade of legal actions engulfing the band, from the earliest days of the&nbsp;lovable&nbsp;mop-heads to their present prickly twilight of cultural sainthood. <br><br>Part Beatles history, part legal thriller, Baby You're a Rich Man begins in the era when manager Brian Epstein opened the Pandora's box of rock 'n' roll merchandising, making a hash of the band's licensing and inviting multiple lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom. The band's long breakup period, from 1969 to 1971, provides a backdrop to the Machiavellian grasping of new manager Allen Klein, who unleashed a blizzard of suits and legal motions to take control of the band, their music, and Apple Records. Unsavory mob associate Morris Levy first sued John Lennon for copyright infringement over "Come Together"; then sued him again for not making a record for him. Phil Spector, hired to record a Lennon solo album, walked off with the master tapes and held them for a king's ransom. And from 1972 to 1975, Lennon was the target of a deportation campaign personally spearheaded by key aides of President Nixon (caught on tape with a drug-addled Elvis Presley) that wound endlessly through the courts. <br><br>In Baby You're a Rich Man, Stan Soocher ties the Beatles' ongoing legal troubles to some of their most enduring songs.

Even today, many believers struggle to find unifying themes in scripture that can make sense of its great diversity. Dauphinais and Levering suggest that holiness--that is, love as communion with God and neighbor--is the common thread that runs through scripture. Holiness, they say, manifests itself in profuse biblical language about a promised land and a holy people, all of which reveals a holy God desiring to recreate us in his image. The authors point out that this idea is as old as the church itself and as new as the work of contemporary biblical scholars. Holy People, Holy Land is a mind-expanding journey through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. The authors reveal that the Old Testament themes of land and Law, temple and covenant, all begin and end with God&#39;s gracious salvific work in Christ, who fulfills the Law, establishes perfect justice, and is the true Temple. This book is intended for undergraduate students in theology and the Bible, both Catholic and Protestant, who seek to learn the story of how love--revealed most prominently in the sacrifice of Christ--creates a holy people equipped to serve God and one another.</p><p></p><h2>Songbirds (Peterson Field Guides: Young Naturalists)</h2><p>This new series is based on the Peterson Identification System, which uses life-like illustrations to help young naturalists make accurate identifications.

Since that time, he's written dozens of novels in several genres, notably the award-winning The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray; Poison; Storm Thief; the Malice series; and the graphic novel, Pandemonium.<br><br>Kirkus Starred<br>Come visit Orokos, an ancient metropolis in serious decay from previous technological heights.<br>The city, controlled by tempests that create chaos in all its sectors and populations, also endures a<br>dictator who maintains a shaky hold between probability storms. Once again, Wooding takes fantasy<br>and science-fiction conventions and gives them a good twist. Descriptions of this closed world as<br>witnessed by teen thieves, Rail and Moa, by a golem escaped during a probability storm and by the<br>head of the secret police himself, make very real the nature of Orokos's dystopia. The two teens,<br>having committed an unforgivable offense against their thief mistress, join with the golem Vago in a<br>quest for freedom from the fetid prison their world has become. Changing points of view, cliffhanger<br>section endings, hair-raising escapes and a bitter betrayal lead to a slam-bang climax and a satisfying,<br>lyrical and surprisingly touching ending. Although strikingly different from The Haunting of Alaizabel<br>Cray (2004) and Poison (2005), this stunning work of speculative fiction will appeal to Wooding's<br>fans and earn him new ones. (Fiction. YA)<br><br>HB<br>Wooding, author of the strange and adventure-filled Poison (rev. 9/05), once more opens his fantastical cabinet of invention, this time for a foray to the island-bound city Orokos, where probability storms change the topography or the inhabitants in the blink of an eye. Buildings vanish to reappear elsewhere, and people may turn to glass or grow extra limbs. Rail and Moa, two ghetto brats with only each other to depend on, steal an artifact of ancient science that enables them to pass through walls, but their thief-master wants the artifact for herself. The two flee to Moa's former home, a secret enclave of visionaries determined to escape the island, but they must first pass through a sector overrun by Revenants, wraiths that kill with a touch and then occupy the body. A stray whom Moa collects along the way, a hideous half-mechanical winged golem, helps combat the Revenants but attracts pursuit from the ruthless secret police. Wooding doles out plot revelations with a generous hand, salting the whole with liberal amounts of mortal peril, but while the wonders and tension keep the pot bubbling merrily, it is the triangle between Rail, Moa, and the initially innocent golem that gives the book its deeper savor. A page-turner to the end, Storm Thief will leave readers longing for more from Wooding's magical imagination. ANITA L. BURKAM<br><br>Booklist<br>Gr. 6 9. The latest from the author of The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray (2004) and Poison (2005) is a post-apocalyptic fantasy with trappings reminiscent of the 1995 film Waterworld. The citizens of Orokos, a crumbling city surrounded by an endless ocean, live at the mercy of probability storms that might steal a baby's eyes and replace them with buttons, or turn a house into sugar paper.&#x201d; Together with the chaotic conditions, the city's totalitarian government makes life miserable for marginalized ghetto-folk&#x201d; like teen thieves Moa and Rail. After the companions stumble upon a valuable artifact, they must flee pursuers who covet their find. Their journey brings them into contact with a half-mechanical homunculus and a group of rebels preparing to escape the city permanently. A familiarity with Frankenstein and Rime of the Ancient Mariner, clear sources of inspiration, will enrich readers' appreciation of the novel, although most will simply like the inventive premise and the protagonists' tender relationship, never overtly romantic but replete with unspoken yearnings.

Her sisters included Lady Diana Mosley; Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire and Jessica, who immortalised the Mitford family in her autobiography Hons and Rebels. The Mitford sisters came of age during the Roaring Twenties and wartime in London, and were well known for their beauty, upper-class bohemianism or political allegiances. Nancy contributed columns to The Lady and the Sunday Times, as well as writing a series of popular novels including The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, which detailed the high-society affairs of the six Radlett sisters. While working in London during the Blitz, Nancy met and fell in love with Gaston Palewski, General de Gaulle&#39;s chief of staff, and eventually moved to Paris to be near him. In the 1950s she began writing historical biographies - her life of Louis XIV, The Sun King, became an international bestseller. Nancy completed her last book, Frederick the Great, before she died of Hodgkin&#39;s disease on 30 June 1973.&#34;Beautifully evokes the period&#34; * Independent on Sunday * &#34;Delightfully gossipy...irreverently lifts the skirts of the dolls of Versailles and rummages about underneath, exposing one gem of irresistible detail after another...A glorious tribute to a glorious age&#34; * Irish Times * &#34;La Mitford plonks the reader amid the seething snobbery and maniacal struggle for High Life that was the Sun King&#39;s regime... brilliantly acerbic&#34; * Observer * &#34;Her style is skilfully succinct; and her wit proceeds from uncommon shrewdness...readers will wish her her book were twice as long&#34; * Sunday Times * &#34;Highly entertaining...written with her accustomed dash and gaiety, in a manner which frequently suggests one of her delightful novels...

The finest in quality and value.</p>Never underestimate the power of prayer. As Monica, the mother of St. Augustine, watched as her son and grandson were being baptized on that bright easter morning in A.D.387, she knew her lifelong prayers had been answered. Even though in his Confessions, Augustine wrote about his early life as an example of how sin grows and works within a person, he was looking back over those early years with the vision of a bishop of the church. Monica could not have known that those prayers would have presented to the church a man who would impact Christianity with the strength that Augustine did.</p><p>SAINT AUGUSTINE (354-430), a philosopher and theologian, was born in the city of Tagaste, the present day Souk Ahras, Algeria. A Latin Father and Doctor of the Church, he is one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity.

Together they oversee Mark Hanby Ministries/Fathers Heart Ministries, an internationally recognized teaching and resource center.Grade 1-3-- Although this resembles a picture book, it is actually, and surprisingly, nonfiction. In an attempt to improve relations between Egypt and France, who were on opposite sides of the Greek war of independence in the 1820s, the pasha of Egypt presented King Charles X with a giraffe, the first in Europe in over three centuries. But in the days before aircraft, how do you send a large, ungainly animal such a long way? The answer is depicted in this book--a sea : voyage to Marseilles, and then a six-week march to Paris. The brief text is written in a chatty style that deals effectively with the logistics of the move and its historical underpinnings. It also includes details that will appeal to young readers: the custom-made giraffe raincoat necessitated by France's cooler climate, the need for a cow in the entourage to provide La Girafe's daily rations, the unusual way a giraffe moves its legs in walking. The illustrations are attractive pastel cartoons and one full-color photograph of the giraffe's stuffed remains, still on display at La Rochelle. The book concludes with a historical note briefly outlining the background of the story. A charming illumination of one of history's more obscure footnotes. --Barbara Hutcheson, Greater Victoria Public Library, B.C., Canada<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Sylvan Shadows (Forgotten Realms)</h2><p>Enter the Forest of Shadows...<br><br><i>In Sylvan Shadows</i> follows Cadderly the scholar-priest, as he leaves his home to combat the evil unleashed by the Chaos Curse.

Judd Foxman is oscillating between a sea of self-pity and a "snake pit of fury and resentment" in the aftermath of the explosion of his marriage, which ended "the way these things do: with paramedics and cheesecake." Foxman is jobless (after finding his wife in bed with his boss) and renting out the basement of a "crappy house" when he is called home to sit shiva for his father--who, incidentally, was an atheist. This of course means seven days in his parent's house with his exquisitely dysfunctional family, including his mom, a sexy, "I've-still-got-it" shrink fond of making horrifying TMI statements; his older sister, Wendy, and her distracted hubby and three kids; his snarky older brother, Paul, and his wife; and his youngest brother, Phillip, the "Paul McCartney of our family: better-looking than the rest of us, always facing a different direction in pictures, and occasionally rumored to be dead." Tropper is wickedly funny, a master of the cutting one-liner that makes you both cringe and crack up. But what elevates his novels and makes him a truly splendid writer is his ability to create fantastically flawed, <em>real</em> characters who stay with you long after the book is over. Simultaneously hilarious and hopeful, <em>This Is Where I Leave You</em> is as much about a family's reckoning as it is about one man's attempt to get it together. The affectionate, warts-and-all portrayal of the Foxmans will have fans wishing for a sequel (and clamoring for all things Tropper). --<em>Daphne Durham</em><p>Jonathan Tropper is the author of <i>How to Talk to a Widower, Everything Changes, The Book of Joe</i>, and <i>Plan B</i>.

Employee-owned firms have long been prominent in the service professions--law, accounting, investment banking, medicine--and are becoming increasingly important in other industries. The buyout of United Airlines by its employees is the most conspicuous recent instance. Farmer-owned produce cooperatives dominate the market for most basic agricultural commodities. Consumer-owned utilities provide electricity to one out of eight households. Key firms such as MasterCard, Associated Press, and Ace Hardware are service and supply cooperatives owned by local businesses. Occupant-owned condominiums and cooperatives are rapidly displacing investor-owned rental housing.

He was still more than fifty paces away. It croaked scornfully and pecked at the staring eyeball with its powerful beak. The lamb was no more than three days old, its meager flesh already devoured by mountain wolves.</p><p>Tarquinius stooped, picked up a small rock, and fitted it to his sling. A slight figure with blond hair, he wore a loose thigh-length tunic, belted at the waist. Sturdy sandals clad his feet.</p><p>"Spare the bird. He did not kill the lamb." Olenus Aesar adjusted his worn leather hat, flattening the blunt peak. "Corvus is only taking what remains."</p><p>"I don't like it eating the eyes." Preparing to release, Tarquinius swung the hide strap in a slow circle.</p><p>The old man fell silent, shielding his eyes from the sun. He spent a long time gazing at the broad wingtips of buzzards hanging on the warm thermals and the clouds farther above.</p><p>Tarquinius watched intently, holding back the stone. Since the soothsayer had picked him as a student years before, the young Etruscan had learned to pay attention to everything he said and did.</p><p>Olenus shrugged bony shoulders under his rough woollen cloak. "Not a good day to kill a sacred bird."</p><p>"Why not?" With a sigh, he let the sling drop to his side. "What is it now?"</p><p>"Go right ahead, boy." Olenus smiled, infuriating Tarquinius. "Do what you want." He waved expansively at the raven. "Your path is your own."</p><p>"I am not a boy." Tarquinius scowled and let the rock fall. "I'm twenty-five!"</p><p>He scowled briefly, then let out a piercing whistle and gestured with one arm. A black and white dog lying close by sprinted off in a wide arc up the steep hillside, eyes fixed on a group of sheep and goats nibbling short grass far above. They spotted him immediately and began moving farther up.</p><p>The raven finished its meal and flapped off.</p><p>Tarquinius gazed after it balefully. "Why shouldn't I have killed that damn bird?"</p><p>"We are standing above what was the temple of Tinia. The most powerful of our gods..." Olenus paused for effect.</p><p>Looking down, Tarquinius noticed a red clay tile protruding from the soil.</p><p>"And the number of buzzards above is twelve."</p><p>Tarquinius's eyes searched the sky, counting. "Why do you always speak in riddles?"</p><p>Olenus tapped his lituus, a small crooked staff, on the broken tile. "Not the first time today, is it?"</p><p>"I know twelve is our people's sacred number, but..." Tarquinius watched the dog, which had begun herding the flock toward them as he wished. "What has that got to do with the raven?"</p><p>"That lamb was the twelfth this morning."</p><p>Tarquinius did a quick calculation. "But I didn't tell you about the one in the gully earlier," he said with amazement.</p><p>"And Corvus wanted to feed right where sacrifices used to take place," the haruspex added enigmatically. "Best leave him in peace, eh?"</p><p>Tarquinius frowned, frustrated that he had not noticed the buzzards first and made the link with the location. He had been too busy thinking about killing wolves.</p><p>It was time to hunt some down. Rufus Caelius, his evil-tempered master, tolerated these excursions only because he could question Tarquinius afterward about Olenus and the state of his flocks. The noble would be displeased to hear about further losses, and Tarquinius was already dreading his return to the latifundium, Caelius's huge estate at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>"How did you know about the lamb in the gully?"</p><p>"What have I spent all these years teaching you? Observe everything!" Olenus turned around, seeing what was no longer there. "This was the center of the mighty city of Falerii. Tarchun, the founder of Etruria, marked out its sacred borders with a bronze plow, over a mile from here. Four hundred years ago, where we are standing would have been thronged with Etruscan people going about their daily business."</p><p>Tarquinius tried to imagine the scene as the haruspex had described it so many times--the magnificent buildings and temples dedicated to the Vestal Virgins, the wide streets paved with lava blocks. He pictured the cheering crowds at boxing contests, racing, and gladiator fights. Nobles presenting wreaths to victorious contestants, presiding over banquets in great feasting halls.</p><p>His eyes cleared. All that remained of Falerii, one of the jewels of Etruria, was a few fallen pillars and innumerable pieces of broken tile. The depth of its decline was brought home to him all over again. Long association with the haruspex meant that his people's history was ever painful. "They took our whole way of life, didn't they?" Tarquinius spat angrily. "Roman civilization has completely copied the Etruscan."</p><p>"Right down to the trumpets announcing the start of ceremonies and battle maneuvers," Olenus added wryly. "They stole it all. After destroying us."</p><p>"Sons of whores! What gives them the right?"</p><p>"It was preordained in the heavens, Tarquinius. You know all this." Olenus stared at the young man before taking in the view that fell away to the east and south. A lake at the bottom of the mountain glistened, reflecting the sun's rays with blinding intensity. "Here we are in the heartland of ancient Etruria." Olenus smiled. "Lake Vadimon at our feet, the foundations of the sacred city below."</p><p>"We are almost the last purebred Etruscans on earth," said Tarquinius bitterly. Defeated and then assimilated by the Romans, few families had continued to marry only others of their kind. His had. And generation after generation, the ancient secrets and rituals had been handed from one haruspex to another. Olenus was one of a long line stretching back to the heyday of Etruscan power.</p><p>"It was our destiny to be conquered," Olenus replied. "Remember that when the foundation stone of the temple was laid many centuries ago..."</p><p>"A bleeding head was found in the soil."</p><p>"My predecessor, Calenus Olenus Aesar, stated it foretold that the people would rule all of Italy."</p><p>"And he was wrong. Look at us now!" cried Tarquinius. "Little better than slaves." There were almost no Etruscans left with any political power or influence. Instead they were poor farmers or, like Tarquinius and his family, workers on large estates.</p><p>"Calenus was the best haruspex in our history. He could read the liver like no other!" Olenus waved his gnarled hands excitedly. "That man knew what the Etruscans could not--or would not--understand at the time. Our cities never unified, and so when Rome grew powerful enough, they were defeated one by one. Although it took over a hundred and fifty years, Calenus's prediction proved correct."</p><p>"He meant those who crushed us."</p><p>Olenus nodded.</p><p>"Bastard Romans." Tarquinius flung a stone after the raven, now long gone.</p><p>Little did he know the haruspex secretly admired his speed and power. The rock flew fast enough to kill any man it struck.</p><p>"A hard thing to accept, even for me," sighed Olenus.</p><p>"Especially the way they lord it over us." The young Etruscan swigged from a leather water bag and passed it to his mentor. "Where is the cave from here?"</p><p>"Not far." The haruspex drank deeply. "Today is not the day, however."</p><p>"You've dragged me all the way up here for nothing? I thought you were going to show me the liver and sword!"</p><p>"I was," replied Olenus mildly. The old man turned and began to walk downhill, humming as he used the lituus to steady himself. "But the omens are not good today. It would be best if you return to the latifundium."</p><p>It had been eight years since he first heard of the gladius of Tarquin, the last Etruscan king of Rome and the bronze liver, one of only a few such templates for soothsayers to learn their art. Tarquinius was chafing to see the ancient metal artifact. It had been the subject of so many lessons, but he knew better than to argue with Olenus, and a few more days would make little difference. He hitched his pack higher, checking that all the sheep and goats had come down.</p><p>"I need a trip up here with my bow anyway. Spend a few days killing wolves." Tarquinius affected a nonchalant tone. "You can't let the bastards think that they can get away with it."</p><p>Olenus grunted in reply.</p><p>Tarquinius rolled his eyes with frustration. He wouldn't get to see the liver until the haruspex was good and ready. Whistling the dog to heel, he followed Olenus down the narrow track.</p><p>Tarquinius left the haruspex sleeping in the little hut halfway down the mountain, the dog curled up by his feet, wood crackling gently in the fireplace. Even though it was a balmy summer night, Olenus's bones had felt the chill.</p><p>The young man picked his way along well-used paths through the sprawling fields, olive groves, and vineyards that surrounded Caelius's enormous villa. When he finally reached it, the thick limestone walls were still warm from the sun.</p><p>The slaves' miserable shacks and the simple farm buildings housing indentured workers were situated to the rear of the main complex. He reached these quarters without seeing a soul. Most people rose at dawn and went to bed by sunset, making escape and return in darkness relatively easy.</p><p>Tarquinius paused at the entrance to the small courtyard and peered into the gloom, seeing nothing.</p><p>A voice broke the silence.</p><p>"Where have you been all day?"</p><p>"Who's there?" Tarquinius hissed.</p><p>"Lucky the foreman's asleep. You'd get a beating otherwise!"</p><p>He relaxed. "Olenus was teaching me about our ancestors, Father. That's far more important than digging in the fields."</p><p>"Why bother?" A short, fat man wove into view, clutching an amphora. "We Etruscans are finished. The butcher Sulla made sure of that."</p><p>Tarquinius sighed. This was an old argument. Sensing their chance to regain some autonomy, many of the remaining Etruscan families and clans had joined Marius's forces in the civil war nearly two decades previously. It had been a calculated gamble that had gone spectacularly wrong. Thousands of their people had died. "Marius lost. So did we," he whispered. "It doesn't mean that the ancient ways need to be forgotten."</p><p>"It was the last opportunity for us to rise up and reclaim ancient glory!"</p><p>"You're drunk. Again."</p><p>"At least I did a full day's work," his father replied. "You just follow that eccentric fool, listening to ramblings and lies."</p><p>Tarquinius lowered his voice. "They're not lies! Olenus teaches me secret rituals and knowledge. Someone has to remember. Before it is all forgotten."</p><p>"Do what you will. The Republic cannot be stopped now." Sergius noisily slurped some wine. "Nothing can stop its damned legions."</p><p>"Go back to bed."</p><p>His father stared at the shrine in the far corner of the courtyard. It was where he spent his sober moments. All its oil lamps had gone out. "Even our gods have abandoned us," he muttered.</p><p>Tarquinius pushed the unresisting figure toward the family's small, damp cell. Wine had reduced the once proud warrior to a lonely, morose drunkard. Just a few years previously his father had been secretly teaching him to use weapons. Tarquinius was now equally proficient with a gladius or an Etruscan battleaxe.</p><p>With a groan, Sergius collapsed onto the straw mattress he shared with Fulvia, Tarquinius's mother. Instantly he began to snore. The young man lay down on the other side of the room and listened to the loud noise. Tarquinius was worried about his father: At the rate Sergius was drinking, he would not live for more than a few years.</p><p>It was a long time before Tarquinius slept, and then he dreamed vividly.</p><p>He was watching Olenus sacrifice a lamb in an unfamiliar cave, cutting its belly open to read the entrails. Looking around the dark space, he could see no sign of the bronze liver or sword that Olenus had spoken about so many times.</p><p>The old man's face changed as he scanned the animal's organs. Tarquinius called out, but could not get Olenus's attention. His mentor seemed totally unaware of him and instead was fearfully watching the mouth of the cave.</p><p>It was impossible to see what was scaring Olenus so much. The haruspex had placed the dark red liver on a slab of basalt and was studying it intently. Every so often he would pause and gaze outside, his fear apparently lessening each time. After what seemed an age, Olenus nodded happily and sat back against the wall, waiting.</p><p>Despite his mentor's apparent contentment, Tarquinius now felt a strong sense of impending dread, which intensified until it was unbearable.</p><p>He ran to the entrance.</p><p>Peering down a steep mountain slope, he saw Caelius ascending with ten legionaries, each face fixed and grim. All the men held drawn swords. In front of them ran a pack of large hunting dogs.</p><p>"Run, Olenus! Run!" Tarquinius cried.</p><p>At last the soothsayer turned with a look of recognition. "Run?" He cackled. "I'd break my neck out there."</p><p>"Soldiers are coming to kill you! Caelius is guiding them."</p><p>Olenus's eyes held no trace of fear.</p><p>"You must flee. Now!"</p><p>"It is my time, Tarquinius. I am going to join our ancestors. You are the last haruspex."</p><p>"Me?" Tarquinius was shocked. Through all the years of teaching, it had never occurred to him that he was being groomed to succeed the old man.</p><p>Olenus nodded gravely.</p><p>"The liver and sword?"</p><p>"You have them both already."</p><p>"No! I don't!" Tarquinius gesticulated frantically.</p><p>Again Olenus seemed not to hear. He stood up and began walking toward the figures at the mouth of the cave.</p><p>Tarquinius felt somebody grab his arm. The cave receded slowly from view as he swam into consciousness. He was desperate to know what had happened to Olenus, but could see no more. The young Etruscan woke with a start. His mother was standing over the bed, looking concerned.</p><p>"Tarquinius?"</p><p>"It was nothing," he muttered, his heart racing. "Go back to sleep, Mother. You need to rest."</p><p>"Your shouts woke me," she answered reproachfully. "Father would have woken, too, if he wasn't drunk."</p><p>Tarquinius's stomach clenched. Olenus had always said never to mention anything he taught. "What was I saying?"</p><p>"Hard to make out. Something about Olenus and a bronze liver. The last of those was lost years ago." Fulvia frowned. "Has the old rascal laid hands on one?"</p><p>"He's not said a thing," Tarquinius replied smoothly. "Go back to bed. You have to be up at dawn."</p><p>He helped Fulvia across the room, wincing at her stooped back and at how much effort it took for her to climb into the low cot. Long years of hard labor had crippled his mother's body.</p><p>"My strong, clever Arun." Fulvia used the sacred term for youngest son. "You are destined for greatness. I feel it in my bones."</p><p>"Hush now." Tarquinius glanced around uneasily. Caelius did not like ancient, non-Roman terms being used. "Get some sleep."</p><p>But Fulvia was undeterred. "I've known it since I first saw your birthmark--the same one Tarchun bore. We could not have given you any other name but Tarquinius."</p><p>He rubbed self-consciously at the red triangular shape on the side of his neck. It was something he had only seen occasiona...</p></p><h2>Myths America Lives By</h2><p>&nbsp;<br> The dream of restoring primitive Christianity lies close to the core of the identity of some American denominations---Churches of Christ, Latter-day Saints, some Mennonites, and a variety of Holiness and Pentecostal denominations.

Murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt along the floor.&#39; Grace Marks. Female fiend? Femme fatale? Or weak and unwilling victim? Around the true story of one of the most enigmatic and notorious women of the 1840s, Margaret Atwood has created an extraordinarily potent tale of sexuality, cruelty and mystery.</p><p>In 1843, a 16-year-old Canadian housemaid named Grace Marks was tried for the murder of her employer and his mistress. The sensationalistic trial made headlines throughout the world, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Yet opinion remained fiercely divided about Marks--was she a spurned woman who had taken out her rage on two innocent victims, or was she an unwilling victim herself, caught up in a crime she was too young to understand? Such doubts persuaded the judges to commute her sentence to life imprisonment, and Marks spent the next 30 years in an assortment of jails and asylums, where she was often exhibited as a star attraction. In <i>Alias Grace</i>, Margaret Atwood reconstructs Marks's story in fictional form. Her portraits of 19th-century prison and asylum life are chilling in their detail. The author also introduces Dr. Simon Jordan, who listens to the prisoner's tale with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. In his effort to uncover the truth, Jordan uses the tools of the then rudimentary science of psychology. But the last word belongs to the book's narrator--Grace herself."<i>Alias Grace</i> has all the pacing of a commercial novel and all the resonance of a classic."<br><i>--Washington Post Book World</i><p>"A stunning novel full of sly wit, compassion and insight, boasting writing that is lyrical, assured, evocative of time and place, and seductive in its power to engage us."<br><i>--Houston Chronicle</i></p><p>"Atwood provides the elements of a walloping good read: suspense, mystery, titillation, and a fully crafted but never ponderous historical milieu."<br><i>--St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i></p><p>"Villain or victim, Atwood's Grace is intriguing company."<br><i>--People</i></p><p>"A shadowy, fascinating novel."<br><i>--Time</i></p></p><h2>Winners</h2><p><p><strong>Alastair Campbell knows all about winning.

Unknown to Susan O'Neal, her widowed mother's new English boarder is a suffragette who has come to organize the neighborhood. Susan slowly becomes aware that Bea is hiding something, and grows suspicious of this woman with whom she has formed a close bond. When her mother disappears, the girl suspects that Bea knows more than she'll admit and demands some answers. She then learns that her mother has become involved in the movement and was arrested during a demonstration that turned riotous. The author's description of the city in the early 1900s accurately shows the hardships endured. Main and secondary characters are believable individuals reacting to situations in a consistent manner as they strive to better their situations. They move within the framework of the plot, interacting with one another, relying on their common sense to help them through a difficult time. Bea's political struggle and the lies she must create in order to continue her work compete with her love for Susan, who wants to know the truth. The author does an excellent job of maintaining a heightened sense of suspense throughout the story. The inclusion of historical information regarding the suffragist movement is an added bonus to this entertaining story.<br><i>Janet Gillen, Great Neck Public Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Genius of Charles James</h2><p>An examination of the career of the fashion designer, Charles James, discusses the fabrics and styles of his dresses, gowns, suits, hats, and other clothing</p><p></p><h2>John Stuart Mill: Victorian Firebrand</h2><p>"A fine new biography," (<i>The New Yorker</i>) finally available in paperback <br><br> Now in paperback, Richard Reeves's beautifully written book is the definitive life of one of the heroic giants of Victorian England.

Just about any work by Simak deserves to be considered a classic and City is no exception, it&#39;s a unique perspective on the race of man and a fantastic read. Being both a dog person and a fan of dystopian and apocalyptic literature, this is by far my favorite Simak story; a powerful and haunting examination of humanity&#39;s ultimate self-absorption. Haunting, thought-provoking, and hard to put down, this book underscores the importance of finding what is meaningful in life. This book is not only about what dogs have to teach us about friendship and loyalty, but about the capacity we have to learn from our own experience.

He won the Nebula and multiple Hugo Awards, and in 1977 was the third writer to be named a Grand Master by SFWA.</p><p></p><h2>Best Loved Passages of the Bible</h2><p>One Scripture verse can cause you to view life in a new way.

Whether in the course of developing relationships, doing business, selecting investments, or accepting invitations, I've found a direct correlation between my location on life's highway and my decisions to turn, exit, stop, or start. Extenuating circumstances beyond my control were always involved, yet more times than not, I was a victim or victor of my own making, achieving or failing because I did or did not put in place the necessary prerequisites to accomplish my desired goals. Now, to be sure, I am not a self-flagellating individual who uses this premise to blame and belittle myself for past decisions and their consequences. No, I am saying that my decisions set the course of my life.</p><p>I have now been married to the same woman, the mother of my children, for over twenty-five years. That relationship decision has set the climate of my life much like a thermostat on a heating system sets the temperature in a room. In keeping with this concept, persons in a room may not know that the temperature is affected by the smallest incremental movement of a drop of mercury in a device at an unnoticed location. In spite of its invisibility to the inhabitants of the room it still affects the comfort level of everyone present. Similarly, my key relationship decision, and many other decisions I have made, affect me and all those around me. Good results are a direct reflection of my ability to think through, discern correctly, and move succinctly from the trajectory of my last decision.</p><p><b></b></p><b>We All Have Our Own Unique Decision-Making Process</b><p>Sometimes we have to make a small decision such as choosing a new hair style or whether to paint the bedroom sky blue or periwinkle. Other times decisions are larger, such as whether or not to move to a new city for a better job, or to keep an old one. We each have our own style and ways to approach the decision-making process. Some of us tend to know exactly what we want. We make up our minds quickly and act immediately. Others prefer to deliberate for a long time, weighing all the angles and options before deciding what to do.</p><p><b>Reflect -- Discern -- Decide</b></p><p>Good decision making in relationships, business, anything, results from a process of reflection -- discernment -- decision. This truth recently emerged in a new light for me. I have had the same COO in my for-profit company for nearly ten years. It was interesting to me to note an observation he made about me. Often people who work with you notice things about you that you have not realized about yourself.</p><p>He advised some business constituents that it was unwise to approach me with a presentation that was long and laborious. He had noticed what I jokingly refer to as my ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), that my attention wearied quickly during presentations like those that included the history of a company and who the founder married in 1802. I really would rather be spared the guillotine of losing my head in the details that are largely irrelevant to what I need to decide. In other words, cut to the chase, answer my questions, and leave me to my own thoughts.</p><p>He also shared with them that the hardest part of doing business with me was the millions of questions I ask in the name of doing due diligence. I smiled at my COO's remarks and thought they were an accurate depiction of my inward reality. Even my staff members on the not-for-profit side of my organization have learned to come to me expecting multiple questions and to be armed with the answers before setting the meeting.</p><p>I do not apologize for this proclivity; I believe that good leaders anticipate tough questions and have at their disposal the answers that predict issues, struggles, and maladies that are inherent in the normal processes of doing business.</p><p>Sound decisions are based on great information, so the more significant the question, the more due diligence I require. I believe important decisions demand stewardship. If we are to be good stewards of great opportunities, we must show respect for those opportunities by the level of diligence to which we prepare for the next move.</p><p>Relationship decisions are among the most opportune choices in your life, and I remind you that no others leave as many footprints alongside your own on life's journey as those you make to unite yourself with another person emotionally, sexually, spiritually.</p><p><b>Curb Appeal</b></p><p>Several years ago, my wife and I purchased a new home. We did so after selling our previous home and nearly doubling our initial expenditure for it. I searched ardently through the better neighborhoods in our city trying to find a home that would yield a similar return in the future should we decide to sell. I had found a good house in a great neighborhood and began to discuss with my friends and family the possibility of purchasing it. To my surprise, one of my friends advised me against getting the house. He said, "I know you so well that I can hear your uncertainty in how you explained the value of the proposed home. You seem as though you are trying to convince yourself that the deal is a good one. In other words, thou dost protest too loudly."</p><p>My friend seemed to know that I wasn't totally happy with the decision to buy that house. It was a great deal, the house would sell easily later, and would no doubt yield a return. The problem was that I didn't really <i>like</i> the house. I liked the deal -- but not the house!</p><p>After this observation, I had to reflect. My goal of getting a house with curb appeal -- that was marketable for resale -- was not equally important as getting a house that I liked. Ultimately, I decided that my enjoyment of the house was a significant consideration that I had minimized.</p><p>Friends, many times we make poor decisions because we have decided what success looks like. Due diligence must include a heart check. Is the goal good looks or good character? Wealth or happiness? Safety or excitement? Is the goal a matter of marrying someone who looks good on paper or looks good in person? Is the goal to find a person who is economically sound or emotionally stable? Yes, you are right. It is possible to have both. But neither is possible if you don't decide that these are the goals. What does success look like to <i>you</i>, what comprises a successful relationship to <i>you</i>?</p><p>After looking at over twenty-eight homes all across the metroplex, I made a choice. By the time I was ready to choose, I had examined the return rate on my investment, the likelihood of foreclosure from my loan, a feasibility study that looked at fair market value (FMV), and comparable properties similar to my investment. The difference this time was that I also factored in the importance of <i>liking</i> what I was going to spend a good number of years paying for.</p><p>You may not be able to imagine buying a home without this vital consideration. In fact, some people make how they <i>feel</i> about their home, how much they <i>like</i> their home, their number one criterion for its purchase. They don't consider the kind of neighborhood it's in, its potential resale value, or where the market for homes in their metro area will be in five years. They only know that it has a great view, new appliances, and feels bright and cheery. Maybe you are less inclined to focus on the business of real estate and have little regard to the profitability of a house. Perhaps you gravitate by nature to the cosmetics of the house and your ability to enjoy it and decorate it. I realize that there are many buyers who are more interested in the feng shui of a house, the convenience of a functional kitchen, and the nearness to schools, and who never consider the resale value.</p><p>Both sets of factors -- your head and your heart -- must come into the equation in making this or any significant decision. You must consider both the hard data as well as the intangible internals.</p><p>So with both sets of data in mind, I finally bought a beautiful family estate on some extensive farm land! Farm land here is a good buy, and the house was all my rather large family would need as we grow into grandchildren and in-laws. My new property, with its extensive acreage, provides a home for bobcats, coyotes, and a few hungry Angus cows. Every morning when I wake up to the sound of squirrels playing in the tree outside my window and rabbits scurrying across the grounds, I know that the value of my home is not just the appraisal. It also includes the happiness for which there is no price tag. This reminds me of the MasterCard commercial in which the price of numerous items are listed followed by the value of the total experience, "priceless."</p><p><b></b></p><b>Small Decisions vs. Large, Financial Decisions</b><p>There is certainly a difference between making small daily decisions such as what to wear or what to order at dinner versus making a larger decision that will have greater consequences in your life. Large decisions, like making a major purchase such as buying a house, can have ramifications for your financial health for years to come. Moving to a new town or community could affect your relationships with your family and friends and could impact your kids, if you have them, for the rest of their lives.</p><p>You are also going to have to make decisions about relationships in your life. Considerations such as whether to enter into one, get out of one, or change the status of a relationship are decisions you'll have to make throughout your life. And those choices are not as easy as the prevalent Hollywood romantic movies today would lead you to believe. In the movies, things typically turn out happily ever after.</p><p>This is not to say that won't be the case for you. There is nothing more gratifying than a relationship with someone you love and trust, with whom you can share your innermost thoughts and feelings. Having a partner to rely on, to hav...</p></p><h2>Hungary and the fall of Eastern Europe 1000-1568: 195 (Men-at-Arms)</h2><p>Although not widely studied in the West, the medieval history of south-eastern Europe is both fascinating and complex. The Kingdom of Hungary was a vast realm, at least the size of France, that endured throughout the Middle Ages whilst the Byzantine Empire was even more extensive and enduring. The Serbians won themselves a brief but extensive local empire in the 14th century; while the Bulgarians established an effective and cultured state. Other players in the confusing Balkan scene included the Albanians; Wallachians; Moldavians; Transylvanians; Croatians and many others.

And Gus will meet the love of his life.</p></p><p>In this prequel to McMurtry's 1986 Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call are invincible young bucks, Texas Rangers, full of youthful energy and, quite frankly, full of themselves. That is until they're utterly consumed by the vicious battlefield of the early-19th-century Wild West. Their journey takes them across barren deserts and raging rivers and through steep and snowy mountains, often on foot and with barely enough provisions and clothing to keep them from certain death. The constant threat of attack by Comanches keeps them awake nights, fearing for their lives--and for good reason. "Buffalo Hump reached down and grabbed the terrified boy by his long black hair. He yanked his horse to a stop, lifted Zeke Moody off his feet, and slashed at his head with a knife, just above the boy's ears. Then he whirled and raced across the front of the huddled Rangers, dragging Zeke by the hair. As the horse increased its speed, the scalp tore loose and Zeke fell free. Buffalo Hump had whirled again, and held aloft the bloody scalp."<p> This bedraggled group of adventurers--on their foolhardy expedition to seize Santa Fe from the Mexicans (who also prove to be formidable enemies)--includes a salty assortment of cowboys, scouts, fortune seekers, and a fat and sassy whore nicknamed "The Great Western." McMurtry's adept storytelling paints a portrait of the Wild West that at times is palpable. One can almost smell the campfires, the body odors, and the long-awaited piece of meat after weeks without a proper meal. <i>Dead Man's Walk</i> will satisfy your craving for adventure, without having to put your life on the line.</p><b>Larry McMurtry</b> is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>.

This Monterrey is a border town whose main industry and source of employment is a massive tile factory. Monterrey is where Dr. Manuel Mendosa has his small surgical clinic. His father had also been a surgeon, attached to the American army in Vietnam. He always maintained that his finest work had been done during the war, as he was able to finesse his reconstructive surgical abilities on the burned and disfigured soldiers. His only son, Manuel, followed in his footsteps and became a qualified plastic surgeon. He had, under his father's watchful eye, opened a practice in Mexico City. After his father's death, Manuel had become addicted to drugs and sunk into debt. Accused of malpractice, he had gone into hiding. Manuel had then been coerced into operating on a known felon, altering the man's features to enable him to escape imprisonment.</p><p>Now, known in the underworld for his prowess, he was forced into performing many similar surgical operations. He was paid highly for his skill and silence, but he was nevertheless trapped and in constant fear for his life, should he ever refuse a request.</p><p>When Manuel received a call from a Mr. Smith, he knew this was yet another "operation" requiring his skill as a surgeon. He knew too that his life would depend upon his silence.</p><p>Mr. Smith was not American but English, and his arrival at the clinic, although expected, was met with trepidation. The patient was so tall he had to stoop to enter the small reception room. He was well dressed in a cream-colored suit and a white T-shirt. He carried a thin leather briefcase.</p><p>If Manuel felt trepidation; so did his new client. Miles from anywhere in the border town, he had arranged the meeting on word of mouth, hearing that Manuel was a genius. He had not expected to confront one of the most handsome men he had ever seen. Manuel was slender with beautiful artistic hands, dark hair swept back from a high forehead, every feature of his face chiseled, teeth white and gleaming. His pale blue cotton shirt with its priest collar, almost like a surgeon's short gown, was obviously handmade. The color made his wide, clear eyes even bluer, like azure.</p><p>He was sitting expectantly as Mr. Smith entered.</p><p>"Good morning," the Englishman said.</p><p>"You needed to see me?" Manuel said quietly, in fluent English.</p><p>"Yes. That is correct."</p><p>"You were recommended?"</p><p>"Yes. By..."</p><p>The Englishman said two names that sent chills down Manuel's stiff spine. He knew who they were -- men he could not refuse.</p><p>"I will pay you in dollars."</p><p>Manuel nodded and watched as the big man sat uncomfortably on one of the hard chairs in the reception area. He had no receptionist and no nurses. Only one person assisted him in his operations -- an elderly Mexican, Enrico, who had worked alongside his father.</p><p>"I will need to take some particulars and discuss exactly what is required."</p><p>"Obviously."</p><p>Manuel liked his deep resonant voice, the way he appeared respectful. And yet there was a domineering confidence about him.</p><p>"Firstly, may I ask your age?"</p><p>"Sixty."</p><p>Manuel leaned forward and picked up a clipboard from the coffee table.</p><p>"Do you suffer from high blood pressure?"</p><p>"Slightly."</p><p>"Have you had any recent operations?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Do you have any heart problems?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Do you have any allergies?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"No allergic reactions to antibiotics?"</p><p>"None."</p><p>Manuel used a slim silver pen to write on his clipboard.</p><p>"Have you any blood disorders?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Do you have transport?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Somewhere to recover after surgery?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Manuel replaced the board onto the coffee table.</p><p>"Now I need to discuss the exact surgical requirements and modifications you would like me to achieve."</p><p>Mr. Smith had started to sweat in the overheated reception; it was eighty degrees outside and there was no air-conditioning in the room. Compared to Manuel, he felt overweight and clumsy.</p><p>"I need to look younger."</p><p>Manuel nodded, watching as Mr. Smith removed from his pocket a large envelope. He took out a thin folded piece of paper.</p><p>"Let me start with the liposuction. I want you to remove the excess fat from my stomach, armpits, and chest area, and I want my buttocks lifted, so they are tighter and stronger. I'll leave it up to you whether implants are required."</p><p>Manuel nodded. That part of the procedure was simple.</p><p>"I will also want my hands looked at, get rid of the age spots, get my fingerprints lasered."</p><p>Manuel nodded and then leaned forward to pick up his clipboard again. He turned over the top page and started jotting down notes.</p><p>"How tall are you?" he asked.</p><p>"Six feet three and a half."</p><p>"Your weight?"</p><p>"Nineteen and a half stone."</p><p>Manuel tapped the silver pen against his perfect teeth as he calculated what the weight was in kilos. Mr. Smith watched him, struck again by his handsomeness. He wondered if he was homosexual. Manuel wore no wedding ring, no jewelry of any kind, not even a wristwatch, and he seemed to remain cool, not perspiring at all in the oppressive heat.</p><p>"You want me to continue?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Right. I want a new face. Nose, cheek implants, maybe even a little chin enhancement, and I want the mole on my right cheek removed."</p><p>Manuel looked up and stared hard as Mr. Smith concentrated on the notepaper. He could see there were some drawings on it. Mr. Smith was showing his age. His gray hair, worn in a ponytail, was thinning, he had a hooked nose. His face had slight jowls and was heavily lined, as if he had spent many years in the sun. His lips were thin and his teeth stained yellowish from smoking. His eyes were dark brown and lined at the corners with hooded lids. Yet he was still what one would describe as handsome -- or had been at one time.</p><p>"May I see that?" Manuel asked, with his hand outstretched.</p><p>Mr. Smith passed over the single sheet of paper. Manuel studied it for a considerable time. There were a number of drawings and indications of what plastic surgery was wanted.</p><p>"This is very extensive and invasive surgery, Mr. Smith."</p><p>"I'm aware of that."</p><p>"When do you want to begin?"</p><p>"After this meeting."</p><p>Manuel continued making his own notes. It was just after ten o'clock in the morning.</p><p>"I also want it all done in one session."</p><p>"That will be impossible. The liposuction alone will take considerable time and it will be painful, requiring a few days to settle before the bandages can be removed. You will also need to wear elastic surgical bandages to maintain the tightness of the skin."</p><p>"Yes, I know."</p><p>"So may I suggest we start with the less invasive surgery and then judge how soon you would be fit enough to begin everything else?"</p><p>"No. I want everything done as soon as possible. I've brought with me the required amount of Fentanyl in preference to any other anesthetic. Are you familiar with this type of -- "</p><p>Manuel interrupted him. "I'm aware of the use of Fentanyl for emergency surgery and that it is now quite commonly used in many hospitals as a fast means of pain blockage. I know how quickly, unlike most anesthetics, it leaves the system. But it's a very potent opiate that can create respiratory depression if oversubscribed. It can be used as an intravenous anesthetic, but I've never employed it."</p><p>"I will determine how much I need."</p><p>"That is a great risk, Mr. Smith, and one I am not prepared to take. You will require a general anesthetic, but it is up to you if you wish to use the Fentanyl as a means of pain relief."</p><p>Manuel put his silver pen back into the breast pocket of his shirt. He hoped his request for a general anesthetic would make his client change his mind. It didn't.</p><p>"Very well. If that's what you advise."</p><p>"Have you eaten anything today?"</p><p>"No, not since midnight."</p><p>Manuel leaned over to a pocket built into the side of the chair. "I will need to call my assistant," he said.</p><p>Mr. Smith noticed for the first time that Manuel was sitting in a wheelchair and it freaked him.</p><p>"Is that a wheelchair?"</p><p>Manuel glanced toward him as he dialed. "One of my own designs -- very light and battery-controlled."</p><p>"You're a cripple?"</p><p>Manuel gave a strange half smile. "Does it worry you? I do not operate with my feet, but if it concerns you..."</p><p>"What's the matter with you?"</p><p>Manuel had dialed a number on his mobile phone, but he didn't connect the call.</p><p>"I was addicted to crack cocaine. My spine was injured in a fall."</p><p>"Are you still an addict?"</p><p>"I will be for the rest of my life, but I am no longer a user. I've been clean for four years." He held the phone up. "Have you changed your mind?"</p><p>Mr. Smith hesitated and then gave a curt shake of his head.</p><p>"Make the call," he said.</p><p>Manuel wished he had walked out, but his client was obviously satisfied, so he called Enrico to come to the surgery.</p><p>In contrast to the reception room, the adjoining operating theater was cold. Mr. Smith felt every hair on his body tingle. He was instructed to use a small shower room to scrub his body clean with the disinfectant provided.</p><p>Then Manuel introduced Enrico, who led Mr. Smith to the table. He had already prepared a row of needles and the vials of Fentanyl. He checked the client's heart rate and blood pressure, which he noted was high -- 180 over 120. He prepared a vein catheter for Mr. Smith's right hand and found a vein easily, attaching it for the anesthetic to be given. An aspirator machine stood ready for the liposuction; large packs of gauze and two big bottles of Xylocaine and adrenaline, plus dark bottles of iodine were at hand. Different rubber tubes were ready to connect to the cannula tubes, to attach to the liposuction machine. Next, Enrico opened Mr. Smith's gown and, using a paintbrush, painted three quadrants, center of his stomach and to both sides.</p><p>He checked that there was an oxygen mask ready and a resuscitation machine in full working order. He attached a small clip onto Mr. Smith's index finger, which led to a machine to enable them to read the heartbeat. All of this was completed in total silence.</p><p>Enrico then went to assist Manuel to scrub up in a large sink. Manuel let him scrub both his hands with ...</p></p><h2>Grover&#39;s New Kitten</h2><p>Full-color photographs of Grover and his new pet show him caring for her, feeding her, brushing her, and gently playing with her</p><p></p><h2>Splendor of Creation: A Biblical Ecology</h2><p>Chapter topics: <br>- Day One - Light<br>- Day Two - Air<br>- Day Three - Earth, Water, Plants<br>- Day Four - Planets and Time<br>- Day Five - Water and Wind Creatures<br>- Day Six - Land Creatures<br>- Day Seven - Shabbat</p><p>Ellen Bernstein is the founder of Shomrei Adamah Keepers of the Earth, the first institution dedicated to cultivating the ecological thinking and practices integral to Jewish life.

The path led to a storybook romance...cruel disillusionment at Hitler's suicide...a traumatic awakening to the swastika's scourge across Europe and upon the Jews...a breathtaking escape from Communists...and a reemergence into the love and lordship of her mother's Jesus.<br> Eventually Maria and her family came to the United States.

From the primitive snake pit to sophisticated methods of brainwashing, literally thousands of techniques have been devised to distort both the body and the mind - and to satisfy the sadistic needs of those who command, perform and witness human torture. In The History of Torture, Daniel P. Mannix examines with honesty and thoroughness every aspect of torture: the professional torturers, many of them history&#39;s most famous men and women; their theories and techniques; the role torture has played in history; and the refinements brought to the practice of torture by individual fanatics, religious groups, the military and entire cultures. The result is information on the infliction of pain for punishment or coercion from pre-history to modern times.

Galloway (1837-1870) was a fiery young slave rebel, radical abolitionist, and Union spy who rose out of bondage to become one of the most significant and stirring black leaders in the South during the Civil War. Throughout his brief, mercurial life, Galloway fought against slavery and injustice. He risked his life behind enemy lines, recruited black soldiers for the North, and fought racism in the Union army's ranks. He also stood at the forefront of an African American political movement that flourished in the Union-occupied parts of North Carolina, even leading a historic delegation of black southerners to the White House to meet with President Lincoln and to demand the full rights of citizenship. He later became one of the first black men elected to the North Carolina legislature. <br> Long hidden from history, Galloway's story reveals a war unfamiliar to most of us.

Yet if Jesus was not taken as divine, he would be of no interest to us. What can that mean now? Paradoxically, the key is his permanent Jewishness. No Christian himself, Jesus actually transcends Christianity.<br><br> Drawing on both a wide range of scholarship as well as his own acute searching as a believer, Carroll takes a fresh look at the most familiar narratives of all&#x2014;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Far from another book about the &#x201c;historical Jesus,&#x201d; he takes the challenges of science and contemporary philosophy seriously. He retrieves the&nbsp;power of Jesus&#x2019; profound ordinariness, as an answer to his own last question&#x2014;what is the future of Jesus Christ?&#x2014;as the key to a renewal of faith.</p><p>James Carroll is a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Suffolk University and a columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>.

In March, two bomb attempts were made on Hitler&#x2019;s life. They failed, but in early April a number of the conspirators were arrested by the Gestapo. One of these was a young Lutheran theologian named Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

A committed pacifist entangled in a plot to kill a tyrant, he wrote, &#x201c;The ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live.&#x201d;2</p><p>Bonhoeffer was executed three weeks before the war ended, before the horrors of 1945 were fully laid bare. Yet there is a hint in his statement that, in the thick of the evil, he had grasped what was now at stake: nothing less than the moral self-destruction, and perhaps the physical self-extinction, of the human species; its &#x201c;continuing to live.&#x201d; He did not survive to articulate the meaning of what he&#x2019;d come to, but in subsequent years the fragments of thought he left flashed through Christian theology like crystal shards through a darkened conscience. That was especially so once Auschwitz was paired with Hiroshima&#x2014;absolute evil absolutely armed: the death camp and the genocidal weapon all at once bracketing the human future. The mad nuclear competition that followed then made the problem of human survival literal.</p><p>Initiating a project for belief that has yet to be accomplished, Bonhoeffer declared himself in a letter to his student and friend Eberhard Bethge: &#x201c;What keeps gnawing at me is the question, . . . who is Christ actually for us today?&#x201d; That line, written in a Nazi cell, is a shorthand proclamation of Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s penetration to the deepest question about the human condition, which raised, for a serious Christian, an equally grave question about Jesus Christ and the tradition that takes its name from him.</p><p>I, too, have found something &#x201c;gnawing at me,&#x201d; if in far shallower ways than the martyred German. As it happens, I was born precisely as Operation Spark was launched. The son of committed Irish Catholics, I fully embraced that legacy and came of age with Jesus Christ at the center of my identity. But as I grew older, tectonic shifts in culture, religion, politics, and structures of thought cracked the foundation of Christ&#x2019;s meaning&#x2014;even for me. Among the many factors that have contributed to that dislocation, none looms larger, I see now, than the still unreckoned-with moral catastrophe faced by Bonhoeffer. He was a first witness to the apocalyptic fervor of the Third Reich, the millennial character of the crisis&#x2014;and the fact that &#x201c;Christendom,&#x201d; a culture in place since Charlemagne and nearly the sole context within which Jesus Christ had been understood, was mortally undermined by racist Nazi imperialism. And Bonhoeffer was one of the first to grasp how the ethical shattering of Christendom extended to the keystone of Christian faith&#x2014;to Jesus himself.</p><p>I begin this grappling with the new actuality of Jesus Christ by recalling Bonhoeffer not just because I associate with his hinted-at intuition that we need a radically reimagined Jesus, but because his undeveloped and rudimentary inquiry was sparked&#x2014;&#x201c;Operation Spark&#x201d; indeed&#x2014;by that brutal confrontation with what has shown itself to be the double-barreled moral problem of our age. The bottomless pit that opened in southern Poland, and into which Bonhoeffer was already staring, was only one chamber of an abyss into which humanity had been plunged also by the devastation of a city in Japan. It was not the scale of bloodshed in these two manifestations that made Auschwitz and Hiroshima historic&#x2014;other genocides and mass bombings compare, from Stalin and Pol Pot on one side to Curtis LeMay and Bomber Harris on another. Rather, it was the character of Auschwitz and Hiroshima as related revelations about the past and future: the anti-Jewish heart of Western civilization, and the vulnerability of the human species to suicide.</p><p>I grew up during the Cold War on bases of the United States Air Force, where my father, an Air Force general, served as a member of America&#x2019;s nuclear priesthood. My otherwise mundane Oedipal reckoning unfolded in the shadow of nuclear Armageddon.3 It was eventually impossible for me to avoid the harsh reality that, taken together, Auschwitz and Hiroshima had changed everything&#x2014;except human ways of thinking and believing.4 A transcendent shift in moral meaning had occurred. Christians regard what the tradition calls the Incarnation as an interruption in history. But so was 1945. Looking back across the decades, it has finally become clear to me how the actualities of that year forced the question: Who is Christ actually?<br><br><b>Religionlessness</b></p><p>Here is Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s full statement to Bethge:</p><p>What might surprise or perhaps even worry you would be my theological thoughts and where they are leading, and here is where I really miss you very much . . . What keeps gnawing at me is the question, What is Christianity, or who is Christ actually for us today? The age when we could tell people that with words&#x2014;whether with theological or pious words&#x2014;is past, as is the age of inwardness and conscience, and that means the age of religion altogether. We are approaching a completely religionless age; people as they are now simply can&#x2019;t be religious anymore. . . . If eventually we must judge even the Western form of Christianity to be only a preliminary stage of a complete absence of religion, what kind of situation emerges for us, for the Church? How can Christ become the Lord of the religionless as well? . . . The question to be answered would be, What does a Church, a congregation, a liturgy, a sermon, a Christian life mean in a religionless world? How do we talk about God without religion? . . . Christ would then no longer be the object of religion, but something else entirely, truly the Lord of the world. But what does that mean? . . . I hope you understand more or less what I mean, and that it&#x2019;s not boring you. . . . Goodbye for now. Yours, as ever. I think about you very much. Dietrich.5</p><p>Existentialist philosophy, psychoanalysis, modernist literature, political engagement for the sake of justice&#x2014;such movements coming to a head after World War II salted the religious self-understanding of Christians, especially in nations bracketing the North Atlantic. Fully developed theologies flourished with figures like Protestants Karl Barth, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Paul Tillich; Orthodox figures like Alexander Schmemann, dean of St. Vladimir&#x2019;s Seminary, in New York; and Catholics of the Second Vatican Council6 like Karl Rahner, Hans K�ng, and John Courtney Murray. Compared with the decades-long contributions of such thinkers, all of whom were implicitly responding to crises engendered by the genocidal violence of the century&#x2019;s wars, Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s sketchy intuitions, offered most significantly in his Letters and Papers from Prison, read like picture captions. But the picture he holds up shows the deep truth of an unprecedented circumstance. It is clear from the passage cited above that the traumatized German was groping for words to express what remained an unspeakable experience. The groping itself is his legacy and challenge.</p><p>Paul Tillich, a German Lutheran twenty years Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s senior, lived to carry on the postwar inquiry&#x2014;mainly because, unlike Bonhoeffer, Tillich responded to Hitler&#x2019;s coming to power by taking up a life in exile in New York. Tillich had been dismissed from his Frankfurt professorship by the Nazis, and he, too, found the crisis of Nazism at the center of his reflections. Like Bonhoeffer, he saw a consequent religionlessness as somehow necessary&#x2014;but also as revelatory. Indeed, it formed the basis of his existentialist theology, which came to fruition in his postwar reflections, especially in the books The Courage to Be (1952) and Dynamics of Faith (1957). Here, in slightly more abstract language, is Tillich&#x2019;s echo of what Bonhoeffer wrote in the letter to Bethge:</p><p>The relation of man to the ultimate undergoes changes. Contents of ultimate concern vanish or are replaced by others . . . Symbols which for a certain period, or in a certain place, expressed the truth of faith for a certain group now only remind of the faith of the past. They have lost their truth, and it is an open question whether dead symbols can be revived. Probably not for those to whom they have died.7</p><p>The most important symbol that had lost its truth for Tillich was the symbol of God Himself, which, after Hitler, had been irrevocably undermined. In The Courage to Be, he wrote,</p><p>God appears as the invincible tyrant, the being in contrast with whom all other beings are without freedom and subjectivity. He is equated with the recent tyrants who with the help of terror try to transform everything into a mere object, a thing among things, a cog in a machine they control. He becomes the model of everything against which Existentialism revolted. This is the God Nietzsche said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into a mere object of absolute knowledge and absolute control. This is the deepest root of atheism. It is an atheism which is justified as the reaction against theological theism and its disturbing implications.8</p><p>In the 1960s, Bonhoeffer was posthumously conscripted into the briefly voguish Death of God movement in Britain and America, which made watchwords of his nascent notions of &#x201c;religionless Christianity&#x201d; and &#x201c;man come fully of age.&#x201d;9 Whether obsequies for &#x201c;theological theism&#x201d; are a function of maturity is debatable, to say the least, yet Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s seemed an uncanny anticipation of Europe&#x2019;s postwar exodus from religion, with the resulting mass redundancy of church buildings and the muting of the voices of clergy. Today, apart from the hollow formalism of royalty-ruled churches in Britain and Scandinavia, institutional religion has entirely vacated the public realm of Europe&#x2014;and, in some places, the private conscience, too.10 In America, the decline of mainstream religion was slower in coming, but the Death of God presented itself as a theological problem more in the United States than anywhere.</p><p>As figures of wide influence, there were no successors on either side of the Atlantic to Tillich, Niebuhr, Schmemann, K�ng, or Murray. Eventually, with salvos from pop culture, screen technologies, and hyperlinks of the Internet, with &#x201c;all talk, all the time&#x201d; draining words of weight and impact&#x2014;universally at the expense of contemplative reading&#x2014;the devastation of inwardness itself could also seem a fulfillment of Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s prophecy. &#x201c;The history of faith,&#x201d; as Tillich put it, &#x201c;is a permanent fight with the corruption of faith.&#x201d; The fight, all at once, seemed lost. The claim of faith was &#x201c;exposed to the continuous test of history.&#x201d;11 And for many, it seemed to fail. The late-twentieth-century arrival of a broadly unchurched culture in the North Atlantic nations, with an apparent legion readily dispensing with theism, especially among educated elites and younger people, seemed to suggest that the Death of God theologians had been grappling with something real. &#x201c;God has hidden his face from the world,&#x201d; as one Jewish Holocaust writer put it, &#x201c;and delivered mankind over to his own savage urges and instincts.&#x201d;12</p><p>Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s focus was on the delivering humans had done, not God, but the &#x201c;absence of religion&#x201d; he predicted turned out not to be &#x201c;complete.&#x201d;13 The &#x201c;Secular Age&#x201d; might have dawned in most of Europe and parts of North America&#x2014;regions of the Enlightenment legacy&#x2014;but even there, assumptions of an earlier age held fast among many. The twenty-first century&#x2019;s so-called new atheism had its answer in a new fundamentalism, whose leaders, notably in the United States, enlisted on the reactionary side of the culture war being fought over flash points like abortion and gay rights.14 On questions ranging from &#x201c;family values&#x201d; to the &#x201c;war on terror&#x201d; to the corporate ethos of retail giants, overt appeals to religion, in fact, defined large segments of American society more than ever.15 &#x201c;Today, one of the most glaring refutations of the case that religion has vanished from public life,&#x201d; as the critic Terry Eagleton puts it, &#x201c;is known as the United States.&#x201d;16 And not just the U.S. Across the globe, religious true belief has solidified identity in a sea of uncertainty.</p><p>Negatively, religion spawned world-historic acts of violence&#x2014;from the 1995 murder in Israel of Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish zealot to the perversion of Allahu Akbar over Manhattan, the Pennsylvania countryside, and the Pentagon in September of 2001 to the God-ordained orgy of killing in Norway in 2011 by a Christian supremacist. One wants to separate such killer-nihilism from &#x201c;true religion,&#x201d; yet jihadist and crusader impulses do have underpinnings in authentic faith. We will investigate that connection in this book.</p><p>But the power of contemporary religion has been showing itself positively, too. Essential to the civil rights, human rights, and peace movements in the West, faith was also key to the nonviolent grass-roots revolution that brought down the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Religion was a pillar of the inchoate Muslim awakening to democracy, so hopefully begun in the Arab Spring of 2011.17 Indeed, independent of politics, religion remains a source of consolation and strength&#x2014;of inwardness and conscience&#x2014;for global multitudes, decisively including impoverished masses to whom material structures of meaning are simply unavailable.</p><p>So was Bonhoeffer wrong? Did religion in fact survive intact, if altered? Did he misconstrue the nature of religionlessness? For that matter, what is religionlessness? I locate this question, first, not in poll numbers or philosophical debates but in a deeply personal problem: having myself absorbed&#x2014;and learned to take for granted&#x2014;basic assumptions of the so-called Secular Age, what of my own religious inheritance can I believe without being dishonest? I am no fundamentalist, and the limits of religion, even its perversity, are fully apparent to me. If the faith continues to impose itself as a primal option, it does so in my case despite&#x2014;or is it because of?&#x2014;the crises of 1945. What happens when traditional belief slams into the wall of the Holocaust? When it plunges into the abyss of Hiroshima? Those questions are what draw me to Bonhoeffer and his crucial intuition that religion and Jesus Christ are not identical. Because Hiroshima had not happened when he was writing, the potential suicide of the human species was not an actual prospect for Bonhoeffer. Yet the &#x201c;continuation&#x201d; of human life had surfaced as an overriding moral problem, and I, a nuclear warrior&#x2019;s son, live to be haunted by it to this day. In Buchenwald, Bonhoeffer may well have had a foretaste of the full horror of Auschwitz, but that particular death camp&#x2019;s meaning as an epiphany of radical evil remained implicit. For me, though, its meaning as an obliteration of inherited...</p></p><h2>Gallipoli</h2><p>This account of the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 brings an epic tragedy to life. As well as taking the reader into the trenches to witness the fear, courage and humour of the soldiers who fought there, describing their experiences, whether Australian, British, New Zealand, French or Turkish, it examines those who led them: the generals and politicians - some brilliant, some ruthless, some hopelessly incompetent - who held the lives of tens of thousands of young men in their hands. From the grand military and political strategies to the squalor of the front line, it is a haunting insight into the realities of war. The struggle for the Gallipoli Peninsula was dominated by the terrain as much as by men and steel, and here the battlefields come alive as the author guides the reader through them, evoking the landscape. Using an intimate knowledge of Gallipoli itself (his researches also took him to the UK, France, Australia and New Zealand), together with storytelling and scholarship, Les Carlyon has written an immediate account of one of modern history&#39;s defining moments.</p><p>Born in 1942, Les Carlyon has been editor of the Melbourne Age,editor-in-chief of the Herald and Weekly Times group and a lecturer in journalism in a career that has established him as one of Australia&#39;s most respected journalists. He has won several awards for his journalism.

One thing becomes painfully clear: The residents of Bizenghast are just dying to come home.</p><p>Gothic horror, New England ghost stories and Loli fashion, along with traditional Japanese manga, are all reflected in this English-language manga. LeGrow's intricate backgrounds, fabulous costumes, architectural fantasias and painterly set pieces introducing each chapter make this book a delectable visual treat. The writing, unfortunately, doesn't rise to the same level. Unconvincingly written newspaper dispatches provide backstory and plot, while dialogue gets across the bare minimum. Dinah, the well-dressed heroine, is troubled by visions of ghosts in the empty buildings of the boarding school where she's been sent to live with an aunt, following the deaths of her parents. Decaying buildings and abandoned graveyards, rendered in a German expressionistic style, provide an impressive background to the low-key story. Dinah and her suitably slender and big-eyed companion, Vincent, meet a variety of creatures who give them a series of clunky riddles to solve. Along their way, they meet several tragically inclined ghosts. The book offers an unsatisfying ending, relying too heavily on its closing "to &#x2013;be continued." The flimsy narrative will most likely be forgiven by many who will simply see it as an excuse to enjoy some very impressive art. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dinah, who was also in the car, suffers from fits that keep her on the brink of madness and allow her to see ghosts. Her only friend is Vincent, a dreamy blond boy, and together they sneak out of the oppressiveness of the house for adventures.

Her parents were Southern Presbyterian missionaries, most often stationed in China, and from childhood, Pearl spoke both English and Chinese. She returned to China shortly after graduation from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1914, and the following year, she met a young agricultural economist named John Lossing Buck. They married in 1917, and immediately moved to Nanhsuchou in rural Anhwei province. In this impoverished community, Pearl Buck gathered the material that she would later use in <i>The Good Earth</i> and other stories of China.<p>Pearl began to publish stories and essays in the 1920s, in magazines such as <i>The Nation, The Chinese Recorder, Asia,</i> and <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i> Her first novel, <i>East Wind, West Wind,</i> was published by the John Day Company in 1930. John Day's publisher, Richard Walsh, would eventually become Pearl's second husband, in 1935, after both received divorces.</p><p>In 1931, John Day published Pearl's second novel, <i>The Good Earth.</i> This became the bestselling book of both 1931 and 1932, won the Pulitzer Prize and the Howells Medal in 1935, and would be adapted as a major MGM film in 1937. Other novels and books of nonfiction quickly followed. In 1938, less than a decade after her first book had appeared, Pearl won the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. By the time of her death in 1973, Pearl had published more than seventy books: novels, collections of stories, biography and autobiography, poetry, drama, children's literature, and translations from the Chinese. She is buried at Green Hills Farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> It was Wang Lung's marriage day. At first, opening his eyes in the blackness of the curtains about his bed, he could not think why the dawn seemed different from any other. The house was still except for the faint, gasping cough of his old father, whose room was opposite to his own across the middle room. Every morning the old man's cough was the first sound to be heard. Wang Lung usually lay listening to it and moved only when he heard it approaching nearer and when he heard the door of his father's room squeak upon its wooden hinges. </p><p> But this morning he did not wait. He sprang up and pushed aside the curtains of his bed. It was a dark, ruddy dawn, and through a small square hole of a window, where the tattered paper fluttered, a glimpse of bronze sky gleamed. He went to the hole and tore the paper away. </p><p> "It is spring and I do not need this," he muttered. </p><p> He was ashamed to say aloud that he wished the house to look neat on this day. The hole was barely large enough to admit his hand and he thrust it out to feel of the air. A small soft wind blew gently from the east, a wind mild and murmurous and full of rain. It was a good omen. The fields needed rain for fruition. There would be no rain this day, but within a few days, if this wind continued, there would be water. It was good. Yesterday he had said to his father that if this brazen, glittering sunshine continued, the wheat could not fill in the ear. Now it was as if Heaven had chosen this day to wish him well. Earth would bear fruit. </p><p> He hurried out into the middle room, drawing on his blue outer trousers as he went, and knotting about the fullness at his waist his girdle of blue cotton cloth. He left his upper body bare until he had heated water to bathe himself. He went into the shed which was the kitchen, leaning against the house, and out of its dusk an ox twisted its head from behind the corner next the door and lowed at him deeply. The kitchen was made of earthen bricks as the house was, great squares of earth dug from their own fields, and thatched with straw from their own wheat. Out of their own earth had his grandfather in his youth fashioned also the oven, baked and black with many years of meal preparing. On top of this earthen structure stood a deep, round, iron cauldron. </p><p> This cauldron he filled partly full of water, dipping it with a half gourd from an earthen jar that stood near, but he dipped cautiously, for water was precious. Then, after a hesitation, he suddenly lifted the jar and emptied all the water into the cauldron. This day he would bathe his whole body. Not since he was a child upon his mother's knee had anyone looked upon his body. Today one would, and he would have it clean. </p><p> He went around the oven to the rear, and selecting a handful of the dry grass and stalks standing in the corner of the kitchen, he arranged it delicately in the mouth of the oven, making the most of every leaf. Then from an old flint and iron he caught a flame and thrust it into the straw and there was a blaze. </p><p> This was the last morning he would have to light the fire. He had lit it every morning since his mother died six years before. He had lit the fire, boiled water, and poured the water into a bowl and taken it into the room where his father sat upon his bed, coughing and fumbling for his shoes upon the floor. Every morning for these six years the old man had waited for his son to bring in hot water to ease him of his morning coughing. Now father and son could rest. There was a woman coming to the house. Never again would Wang Lung have to rise summer and winter at dawn to light the fire. He could lie in his bed and wait, and he also would have a bowl of water brought to him, and if the earth were fruitful there would be tea leaves in the water. Once in some years it was so. </p><p> And if the woman wearied, there would be her children to light the fire, the many children she would bear to Wang Lung. Wang Lung stopped, struck by the thought of children running in and out of their three rooms. Three rooms had always seemed much to them, a house half empty since his mother died. They were always having to resist relatives who were more crowded -- his uncle, with his endless brood of children, coaxing. </p><p> "Now, how can two lone men need so much room? Cannot father and son sleep together? The warmth of the young one's body will comfort the old one's cough." </p><p> But the father always replied, "I am saving my bed for my grandson. He will warm my bones in my age." </p><p> Now the grandsons were coming, grandsons upon grandsons! They would have to put beds along the walls and in the middle room. The house would be full of beds. The blaze in the oven died down while Wang Lung thought of all the beds there would be in the half empty house, and the water began to chill in the cauldron. The shadowy figure of the old man appeared in the doorway, holding his unbuttoned garments about him. He was coughing and spitting and he gasped. </p><p> "How is it that there is not water yet to heat my lungs?" </p><p> Wang Lung stared and recalled himself and was ashamed. </p><p> "This fuel is damp," he muttered from behind the stove. </p><p> "The damp wind -- " </p><p> The old man continued to cough perseveringly and would not cease until the water boiled. Wang Lung dipped some into a bowl, and then, after a moment, he opened a glazed jar that stood upon a ledge of the stove and took from it a dozen or so of the curled dried leaves and sprinkled them upon the surface of the water. The old man's eyes opened greedily and immediately he began to complain. </p><p> "Why are you wasteful? Tea is like eating silver." </p><p> "It is the day," replied Wang Lung with a short laugh. "Eat and be comforted." </p><p> The old man grasped the bowl in his shriveled, knotty fingers, muttering, uttering little grunts. He watched the leaves uncurl and spread upon the surface of the water, unable to bear drinking the precious stuff. </p><p> "It will be cold," said Wang Lung. </p><p> "True -- true -- " said the old man in alarm, and he began to take great gulps of the hot tea. He passed into an animal satisfaction, like a child fixed upon its feeding. But he was not too forgetful to see Wang Lung dipping the water recklessly from the cauldron into a deep wooden tub. He lifted his head and stared at his son. </p><p> "Now there is water enough to bring a crop to fruit," he said suddenly. </p><p> Wang Lung continued to dip the water to the last drop. He did not answer. </p><p> "Now then!" cried his father loudly. </p><p> "I have not washed my body all at once since the New Year," said Wang Lung in a low voice. </p><p> He was ashamed to say to his father that he wished his body to be clean for a woman to see. He hurried out, carrying the tub to his own room. The door was hung loosely upon a warped wooden frame and it did not shut closely, and the old man tottered into the middle room and put his mouth to the opening and bawled, </p><p> "It will be ill if we start the woman like this -- tea in the morning water and all this washing!" </p><p> "It is only one day," shouted Wang Lung. And then he added, "I will throw the water on the earth when I am finished and it is not all waste." </p><p> The old man was silent at this, and Wang Lung unfastened his girdle and stepped out of his clothing. In the light that streamed in a square block from the hole he wrung a small towel from the steaming water and he scrubbed his dark slender body vigorously. Warm though he had thought the air, when his flesh was wet he was cold, and he moved quickly, passing the towel in and out of the water until from his whole body there went up a delicate cloud of steam. Then he went to a box that had been his mother's and drew from it a fresh suit of blue cotton cloth. He might be a little cold this day without the wadding of the winter garments, but he suddenly could not bear to put them on against his clean flesh. The covering of them was torn and filthy and the wadding stuck out of the holes, grey and sodden. He did not want this woman to see him for the first time with the wadding sticking out of his clothes. Later she would have to wash and mend, but not the first day. He drew over the blue cotton coat and trousers a long robe made of the same material -- his one long robe, which he wore on feast days only, ten days or so in the year, all told. Then with swift fingers he unplaited the long braid of hair that hung down his back, and taking a wooden comb from the drawer of the small, unsteady table, he began to comb out his hair. </p><p> His father drew near again and put his mouth to the crack of the door. </p><p> "Am I to have nothing to eat this day?" he complained. "At my age the bones are water in the morning until food is given them." </p><p> "I am coming," said Wang Lung, braiding his hair quickly and smoothly and weaving into the strands a tasseled, black silk cord. </p><p> Then after a moment he removed his long gown and wound his braid about his head and went out, carrying the tub of water. He had quite forgotten the breakfast. He would stir a little water into corn meal and give it to his father. For himself he could not eat. He staggered with the tub to the threshold and poured the water upon the earth nearest the door, and as he did so he remembered he had used all the water in the cauldron for his bathing and he would have to start the fire again. A wave of anger passed over him at his father. </p><p> "That old head thinks of nothing except his eating and his drinking," he muttered into the mouth of the oven; but aloud he said nothing. It was the last morning he would have to prepare food for the old man. He put a very little water into the cauldron, drawing it in a bucket from the well near the door, and it boiled quickly and he stirred meal together and took it to the old man. </p><p> "We will have rice this night, my father," he said. "Meanwhile, here is corn." </p><p> "There is only a little rice left in the basket," said the old man, seating himself at the table in the middle room and stirring with his chopsticks the thick yellow gruel. </p><p> "We will eat a little less then at the spring festival," said Wang Lung. But the old man did not hear. He was supping loudly at his bowl. </p><p> Wang Lung went into his own room then, and drew about him again the long blue robe and let down the braid of his hair. He passed his hand over his shaven brow and over his cheeks. Perhaps he had better be newly shaven? It was scarcely sunrise yet. He could pass through the Street of the Barbers and be shaved before he went to the house where the woman waited for him. If he had the money he would do it. </p><p> He took from his girdle a small greasy pouch of grey cloth and counted the money in it. There were six silver dollars and a double handful of copper coins. He had not yet told his father he had asked friends to sup that night. He had asked his male cousin, the young son of his uncle, and his uncle for his father's sake, and three neighboring farmers who lived in the village with him. He had planned to bring back from the town that morning pork, a small pond fish, and a handful of chestnuts. He might even buy a few of the bamboo sprouts from the south and a little beef to stew with the cabbage he had raised in his own garden. But this only if there were any money left after the bean oil and the soybean sauce had been bought. If he shaved his head he could not, perhaps, buy the beef. Well, he would shave his head, he decided suddenly. </p><p> He left the old man without speech and went out into the early morning. In spite of the dark red dawn the sun was mounting the horizon clouds and sparkled upon the dew on the rising wheat and barley. The farmer in Wang Lung was diverted for an instant and he stooped to examine the budding heads. They were empty as yet and waiting for the rain. He smelled the air and looked anxiously at the sky. Rain was there, dark in the clouds, heavy upon the wind. He would buy a stick of incense and place it in the little temple to the Earth God. On a day like this he would do it. </p><p> He wound his way in among the fields upon the narrow path. In the near distance the grey city wall arose. Within that gate in the wall through which he would pass stood the great house where the woman had been a slave girl since her childhood, the House of Hwang. There were those who said, "It is better to live alone than to marry a woman who has been slave in a great house." But when he had said to his father, "Am I never to have a woman?" his father replied, "With weddings costing as they do in these evil days and every woman wanting gold rings and silk clothes before she will take a man, there remain only slaves to be had for the poor." </p><p> His father had stirred himself, then, and gone to the House of Hwang and asked if there were a slave to spare. </p><p> "Not a slave too young, and above all, not a pretty one," he had said. </p><p> Wang Lung had suffered that she must not be pretty. It would be something to have a pretty wife that other men would congratulate him upon having. His father, seeing his mutinous face, had cried out at him, </p><p> "And what will we do with a pretty woman? We must have a woman who will tend the house and bear children as she works in the fields, and will a pretty woman do these things? She will be forever thinking about clothes to go with her face! No, not a pretty woman in our house. We are farmers. Moreover, who has heard of a pretty slave who was virgin in a wealthy house? All the young lords have had their fill of her. It is better to be first with an ugly woman than the hundredth with a beauty. Do you imagine a pretty woman will think your farmer's hands as pleasing as the soft hands of a rich man's son, and your sunblack face as beautiful as the golden skin of the others who have had her for their pleasure?" </p><p> Wang Lung knew his father spoke well. Nevertheless, he had to struggle with his flesh before he could answer. And then he said violently, </p><p> "At least, I will not have a woman who is pock-marked, or who has a split upper lip." </p><p> "We will have to see what is to be had," his father replied. </p><p> Well, the woman was not pock-marked nor had she a split upper lip. This much he knew, but nothing more. He and his father had bought two silver rings, washed with gold, and silver earrings, and these his father had taken to the woman's owner in acknowledgment of betrothal. Beyond this, he knew nothing of the woman who was to be his, except that on this day he could go and get her. </p><p> He walked into the cool darkness of the city gate. Water carriers, just outside, their barrows laden with great tubs of water, passed to and fro all day, the water splashing out of the tubs upon the stones. It was always wet and cool in the tunnel of the gate under the thick wall of earth and brick; cool even upon a summer's day, so that the melon vendors spread their fruits upon the stones, melons split open to drink in the moist coolness. There were none yet, for the season was too early, but baskets of small hard green peaches stood along the walls, and the vendor cried out, </p><p> "The first peaches of spring -- the first peaches! Buy, eat, purge your bowels of the poisons of winter!" </p><p> Wang Lung said to himself, </p><p> "If she likes them, I will buy her a handful when we return." ...</p></p><h2>Mary Anne&#39;s Bad-Luck Mystery (Baby-sitters Club)</h2><p>A discarded chain letter augers a series of bad events for Mary Anne, who is plagued by bad luck and a threatening note demanding a midnight meeting on Old Man Sutcliff&#39;s grave.</p><p></p><h2>My Heart&#39;s Desire: Living Every Moment in the Wonder of Worship</h2><p>Experiencing the presence of God is not designed to be a Sunday-only event. Jesus wants to be just as close and real to us on Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon. In My Heart&#39;s Desire Dr. David Jeremiah explains how to make worship a moment-by-moment reality in the reader&#39;s life. It&#39;scalled &#34;lifestyle worship,&#34; and it&#39;s all about placing the worship of God at the center of our lives. Readers will enjoy a new sense of purpose, greater joy and please, as well as a deeper relationship with God and others.</p><p>DR. DAVID JEREMIAH is the senior pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church in El Cajon, California, and chancellor of Christian Heritage College. A best-selling author, he has written and coauthored many books, including A Bend in the Road, Escape the Coming Night, and The Handwriting on the Wall. Dr. Jeremiah is the host of the internationally syndicated radio and television program, Turning Point. He and his wife, Donna, live in El Cajon.G.K. Chesterton famously said, "The world is not lacking in wonders, but in a sense of wonder." Especially in an age of cynicism, this sense of wonder, according to Jeremiah, is at the heart of true worship. They are both, he writes, "about coming to the end of our measurements." Jeremiah, pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church in El Cajon, Calif., and author of A Bend in the Road and The Handwriting on the Wall, joins the throng of popular pastors (Jim Cymbala, Steve Fry, etc.) writing books about "practicing the presence of God." Worship, he maintains, involves one's whole self; it's about being passionate, obedient and trusting God. These aren't new insights, and they aren't particularly deep. But they are presented here in the endearing and practiced if sometimes rambling voice of an evangelical preacher. He moves easily from theme to theme, sprinkling the material with short stories (including many old chestnuts), Scripture (sometimes engaged superficially, sometimes with more depth) and not a few handy lists of practical tips. His treatment of serious worship themes is a bit shallow: he discusses sacrifice without mentioning the Lord's Supper, and he reviews a Psalm of lament (Ps. 137) while speaking of joyful worship. The worship leader on the front lines of America's "worship wars" debating liturgical style and structure will find little help here, other than the reminder that the details of our worship are less important than the spiritual dynamics that undergird them.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>SLAM!

While other girls sew dresses, host dinner parties, and obey their male Protectors, Rachel knows how to survive in the wilderness and deftly wield a sword. When her father, Jared, fails to return from a courier mission and is declared dead, the Commander assigns Rachel a new Protector, her father's apprentice, Logan--the same boy Rachel declared her love for two years ago, and the same boy who handed her heart right back to her. Left with nothing but fierce belief in her father's survival, Rachel decides to escape and find him herself. But treason against the Commander carries a heavy price, and what awaits her in the Wasteland could destroy her. <br><br>At nineteen, Logan McEntire is many things. Orphan. Outcast. Inventor.

Logan is determined to protect her, but when his escape plan goes wrong and Rachel pays the price, he realizes he has more at stake than disappointing Jared. <br><br>As Rachel and Logan battle their way through the Wasteland, stalked by a monster that can't be killed and an army of assassins out for blood, they discover romance, heartbreak, and a truth that will incite a war decades in the making.</p><p>C.J.

For more on C.J., please visit her website at cjredwine.com.In this distinctively imagined dystopian fantasy, Rachel and Logan must throw their lots together in order to fight for justice against a cruel city-state dictator known as the Commander. At 15, Rachel possesses qualities normally forbidden to girls, such as fighting skills, self-confidence, and a nurtured belief in her own independence. Logan, a few years older, became her courier father&#x2019;s apprentice when he was an orphan. Now that her father has disappeared, the teens discover, to their mutual dissatisfaction, that Logan has been named Rachel&#x2019;s protector. In alternating voices, Redwine unfolds the adventures, threats, deep disappointments, and hard-won gains the two teens experience. Logan is a tech whiz who places logic and planning above quick response, while Rachel&#x2019;s passionate disposition has her reaching further than she can readily grasp. The fantasy elements include a fearsome beast known as the Cursed One, a kind of underground dragon the Commander uses to control the common people. Fans of Ursula K.

Jones of the picture book set! <br><br>Daisy is a sassy, know-it-all kid who likes to point out adult inconsistencies. Luckily she has a mom with a great sense of humor. These two are friends as well as parent and child, and their mutual teasing reflects a very current and common style of parenting. <br><br>In the first book in this popular UK series, <i>Eat Your Peas</i>, Daisy and her mom engage in a dinnertime debate over Daisy's reluctance to eat her peas. Her mom, in humorous desperation, offers her increasingly outrageous incentives to eat the unpleasant vegetables until Daisy points out that Mom doesn't eat her brussels sprouts. This dinnertime battle of wills is sure to amuse children and parents alike, as it shows the power of vegetables to turn a meal into an epic struggle.</p><p>It's dinnertime and Daisy knows what her mom is going to say even before she says it. "Eat your peas." Looking down at "the little green balls that were ganging up on her plate," Daisy says, "I don't like peas." And round one of the eternal pea battle has begun. Daisy's mother skips over the cajoling, begging, ordering phase, and jumps straight into barter mode. "If you eat your peas, you can have a dish of ice cream." Ha! We laugh at Mom's naivet�. No, Daisy won't settle for a simple dish of ice cream. The bargaining quickly escalates. Soon her subtly shrinking mother is promising 48 dishes of ice cream, permission to stay up past midnight, a reprieve from ever having to wash again, two new bikes, and a baby elephant. And still the ever-bigger Daisy responds, "I don't like peas."<p> No question about it: this story will strike a chord with more than a few young readers and their long-suffering parents. Daisy's ultimate comeback will tickle readers of all ages, as she challenges her mother's own aversion to brussels sprouts. Nick Sharratt's crisp bright images of the gradually shifting power at the table are pleasing in their cartoon-like simplicity. Parents will want to keep a copy of this by the kitchen table to lighten up the often tense, wearying mealtime clash. (Ages 3 to 7) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>It was dinner-time again and Daisy just knew what her mum was going to say, even before she said it ? ?Eat your peas?. Daisy looked down at the little green balls that were ganging up on her plate. ?I don?t like peas?, said Daisy. And so the battle of wills between Daisy and her mum began. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Fighting for Liberty and Virtue: Political and Cultural Wars in Eighteenth-Century America</h2><p>New insights into the interplay of American politics, religion, sex, and revolution in the 18th century.</p><p></p><h2>Who needs theology?: Invitation To The Study Of God</h2><p>Who Needs Theology? An Invitation to the Study of God by Stanley J. Grenz and Roger E. Olson</p><p>To many Christians today theology means something alien, overly intellectual and unappealing. Even seminarians are known to balk at it. Yet theology - most simply, the knowledge of God - is essential to the life and health of the church. In Who Needs Theology? two theologians who care profoundly about the witness of ordinary Christians show what theology is, how every believer (earned degrees or not) is a theologian, what tools theology uses, and how lay - as well as professional - theologians can do better theology. This clear, eminently accessible book is ideal for students, church study groups and individual laypersons who want to enrich their discipleship through the riches of theology.Stanley J. Grenz (1950-2005) earned a B.A. from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1973, an M.Div. from Denver Seminary in 1976 and a D.Theol. From the University of Munich (Germany) in 1978, where completed his dissertation under the supervision of Wolfhart Pannenberg.<br><br> Ordained into the gospel ministry in 1976, Grenz worked within the local church context as a youth director and assistant pastor (Northwest Baptist Church, Denver), pastor (Rowandale Baptist Church, Winnipeg), and interim pastor. In addition he preached and lectured in numerous churches, colleges, universities and seminaries in North America, Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia.<br><br> Grenz wrote or cowrote twenty-five books, the most recent of which is <em>Rediscovering the Triune God: The Trinity in Contemporary Theology</em> (2004).

Gloves have been used since prehistoric times, but in Britain their use as formal and fashionable items took off during Elizabeth I&#39;s reign, and played a surprisingly significant cultural role well into the nineteenth century. They were often given as precious gifts, used in coronation ceremonies, sent to indicate assent, or even to offer a formal challenge. This beautifully illustrated history, published in association with the Worshipful Company of Glovers of London, delves into the glove&#39;s place in history, offers detailed descriptions of their production in the artisanal workshop and on the factory floor, and also tells the fascinating story of the closely guarded privileges of the glove-makers&#39; guilds.</p><p><b>Mike Redwood</b> has been in the glove business for three decades.

Walls washed flamingo pink on top, deep matte blue on the bottom. A green flatbed truck heaped with orange marigolds. A sea of colorful skeletons at a Day of the Dead fiesta. The radiant reds, yellows, purples, and greens of the fruits and vegetables at <i>el mercado</i>. <i>Mexicolor</i> explores Mexico high and low, from colonial towns to dazzling beaches, from traditional ?workshops to contemporary interiors, from open markets to extraordinary homes and inns, uncovering the colorful artistry that permeates everyday life across this vast nation. <i>Mexicolor</i> is an ideal resource for anyone looking to brighten a home, and a beautiful picture book brimming with imagination, creative ideas, and pure pleasure.?</p><p>Radiant color is not merely joyously prevalent in Mexico, it is part of the national psyche. According to this energetic celebration of Mexican style, "the color that floods Mexico's streets and plazas, markets and homes (and the pages of this book) is language and metaphor--a form of communication, deeply bound to experience. Day and night, birth and death, rich and poor, feast and famine: color is always there. Earth, sky, and history conspire to make it so." The profusion of multihued walls, tiles, ceramics, textiles, and folk art that fill the home; the riotous juxtapositions of vivid foods, flowers, supplies, and accessories that comprise the spectacle of the marketplace; the vibrant details that define everything from facades to clothing to handpainted toys--the Mexican obsession with color is everywhere, as is strikingly documented in this lively book. <i>--Amy Handy</i>Tony Cohan has spent much of the past 12 years in Mexico. He is the author of four novels, and his reviews, essays, and travel writing on Mexico have appeared in numerous magazines.</p><h2>Salad Days: Boost Your Health and Happiness with 75 Simple, Satisfying Recipes for Greens, Grains, Proteins, and More</h2><p>Amy Pennington will make you crave salads with these 75 recipes that feature not just greens with zesty dressings but also incorporate satisfying proteins, such as fish, chicken, eggs, cheese, and nuts, as well as other toothsome ingredients like grains and noodles, and even fruit.<br><br> Simple, nutritious, and tasty, salads have moved from a side dish to main meals as people move towards healthier foods. <i>Salad Days</i> is organized according to how and when we eat--featuring grain bowls, fast and fresh salads, winter salads, noodle salads, fruit salads, cooling salads, and salads for a crowd--making it easy to identify just the right salad to satisfy a craving or occasion.

Nothing else creates an erotically taut, arched foot or an overall come-hither silhouette quite like the stiletto heel.This exquisite book uncovers the compelling lure of the needle heel. </p><p>A highly charged symbol, the stiletto suggests a multitude of contradictions - it can be elegant, vulgar, submissive, aggressive, subversive, conventional. The stiletto is phallic but supremely female, it makes the wearer at once vulnerable and in control. Six decades have seen the stiletto in vogue around the world with an ever-changing, kaleidoscopic clientele of classic ladies, Hollywood stars, fetishists, punks, princesses, power- dressers, cross-dressers, A-list celebrities, and the girl next door. For the first time, Stiletto attempts to uncover the compelling lure of the needle heel. </p><p>Caroline Cox presents the various incarnations of the stiletto since its invention as a fantasy shoe brought to life by the flair and skill of shoemakers Vivier, Perugia, Ferragamo, and Jourdan in the early 1950s. Assertively modern, stilettos released women from the utilitarian wartime fashion of the 1940s, offering streamlined sophistication and glamour to women the world over. As the decade progressed the heel became saucier and higher, worn by starlets like Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield. By the end of the 1950s the heel was being worn by &#x201c;bad girls&#x201d; and had become a weapon of female power. The 1970s took the stiletto&#x2019;s associations with sex and death and turned it into a fetish object, eulogized by artists Allen Jones and Eric Stanton. 1980s power dressers brought the stiletto back into the fashion arena, and today heels designed by Manolo Blahnik, Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, and Gina are the badge of celebrity status and fashion savvy. </p><p>This exciting new book by an international fashion authority presents the story of the stiletto for the first time, illustrated with new and vintage photography to explore the stiletto&#x2019;s long relationship with sex, power femininity, fashion, and fetishism.</p></p><p><p>Caroline Cox, professor of cultural history at the University of the Arts London, is a leading fashion authority whose work explores the relationship between fashion, beauty, and culture.

As a black man in America during times of extreme racial turbulence, Washington had the privilege of being personally acquainted with prominent public figures such as Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Carnegie, Frederick Douglass, H.G. Wells and Mark Twain. The distinguished Booker T. Washington was also the first black man to dine with the president of the United States, to have tea with the Queen of England, and to receive honorary degrees from Harvard and Dartmouth.<p><br>Washington was only twenty-five years old when he founded Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute on July 4, 1881. He started with absolutely no capital and built the institution on sheer faith and determination. Virtually every building on campus was built by Tuskegee students, and they also manufactured the dormitory pillows and mattresses.</p><p><br>In addition to providing Tuskegee students with quality academic programs, Booker T. Washington also emphasized personal discipline, morality, integrity, cleanliness, and the practical aspects of life that could not be learned in textbooks alone. Washington even once said, The cleaning of rooms has a great deal to do with forming one s character. </p><p> <br>As a monument to a great leader, the centerpiece of the Tuskegee University campus in Alabama is a bronze statue of a dignified and well-dressed Booker T. Washington next to a poor black man with a textbook. The message beneath the compelling figures states, He lifted the veil of ignorance from his people and pointed the way to progress through education and industry. </p><p>Booker T. Washington s life proves that he gave up his rights to help the less fortunate achieve greater progress in many ways. As one who was a friend to presidents, millionaires and other world leaders, he was one of the most influential black men in America. Yet he still chose a life of great sacrifice in order to improve conditions for others rather than simply indulge in the benefits of his fame and influence.</p></p><h2>NIV The Case for Christ Study Bible: Investigating the Evidence for Belief, Italian Duo-Tone, Berry Creme / Chocolate (New International Version)</h2><p>Drawn from Lee Strobel&#39;s own experiences as a former atheist engaged in a thorough search for truth, the articles and notes throughout The Case for Christ Study Bible provide a solid explanation of where the historical and scientific evidence point---toward the existence of a compassionate Creator God and his Son, Jesus, the Savior. The Case for Christ Study Bible features more than 500 notes and articles, including: * The Case for a Creator: highlighting the wonders of creation and demonstrating how the scientific evidence supports belief in an all-powerful Creator. * The Case for the Bible: exploring the character of the Bible, the extra-biblical evidence that corroborates scripture, and apparent contradictions. * The Case for Christ: investigating Jesus&#39; claims, Messianic identity, deity, and resurrection. * And much more. The Good News of the Gospel transformed the life of this former atheist. It can do the same for others who commit to examining the evidence for themselves.</p><p>Lee Strobel was the award-winning legal editor of The Chicago Tribune and is the best-selling author of The Case for Faith, The Case for Christ, and The Case for a Creator, all of which have been made into documentaries by Lionsgate.

After the war. The words blended into the clang of the wheels. Would there ever be an end to the war?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate Leipciger, a thoughtful, shy eleven-year-old boy, is plunged into an incomprehensible web of ghettos, concentration and death camps during the German occupation of Poland. As he struggles to survive, he forges a new, unbreakable bond with his father and yearns for a free future. But when he is finally liberated, the weight of his pain will not ease, and his memories remain etched in tragedy. Introspective, complicated and raw, <i>The Weight of Freedom</i> is Nate&#x2019;s journey through a past that he can never leave behind.</p><p>Nate&#x2019;s journey through a past that he can never leave behind.<strong>Nate Leipciger</strong> was born in Chorz�w, Poland. He chaired the Toronto Holocaust Remembrance Committee for six years before becoming an executive member of the Canadian Jewish Congress National Holocaust Remembrance Committee; he was a member of the International Council of Auschwitz for fifteen years. He has educated adults and youth through countless speaking events and has been an educator on March of the Living trips to Poland and Israel for more than ten years. Nate Leipciger lives in Toronto and remains actively involved in Holocaust education.</p><h2>Illusion</h2><p>Arriving in the capital city of Sherreen to take her place at court, Miss Eliste vo Derrivale is suddenly stripped of her rank, home, and family during v&#39;Aleur&#39;s reign of terror</p><p>Okay, it&#39;s a retelling of the French Revolution, but there&#39;s magic in this story. You know what&#39;s going to happen by page 3, though some of the particulars differ. The familiar-seeming background makes the sorcery-touched story that much more engrossing. Read this for Volsky&#39;s wonderful fillips of detail, which make her story live and breathe, and read it for her engaging characters: Eliste&#39;s education in the gilded palace of the Beviaire and in the streets of Shereen, Dref Zeenoson&#39;s rise, ingenious Uncle Quinz&#39;s illusions. But watch out: it&#39;s nearly impossible to stop reading this absorbing, densely-plotted novel, and that&#39;s the real magic.Give the Russian Revolution a French ambiance, add a dollop of American spirit and a dash of magic--and you have some idea of the setting for this bulky but entertaining historical fantasy. Young, purblind country Exalted (aristocrat) Eliste refuses to recognize her feelings for the handsome, educated, mannerly, admirable Dref--the latter, you see, is a serf, virtually a slave; and soon, when he defies Eliste's vicious father, Dref is forced to flee. So Eliste journeys to the city Sherreen to meet the King and Queen, where, preoccupied by the lustfully prolonged and unwelcome attentions of the King's brother, she fails to notice that the underclasses are threatening rebellion--until a mob bursts in to sack the palace. Whereupon the triumphant rabble-rouser Whiss Valeur institutes, with magical help, a reign of terror whose victims include not only the King and hapless Exalteds but anyone who dares oppose him. Only after a terrified Eliste endures dreadful privations and near-death will she throw off her aristocratic ways, meet up with Dref (a steadfast democrat, leading the resistance), and summon up some potent magical aid of her own to defeat the unspeakable Whiss. Surprisingly absorbing and agreeable, given the stereotyped characters and general air of predictability, with unobtrusive yet well thought-out magical notions and a backdrop of genuine depth and consistency. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

One looks like the stuff of nightmares, while the other is &#34;a conduit through which the holy force of Good could work its will in the physical world.&#34; Together, they have traveled throughout the archipelagic Lhazaar Principalities sharing numerous wild adventures, but none were as dangerous as the one they currently face. When a gang of bloodthirsty pirates kidnaps Diran&#39;s former lover (a beautiful ex-mercenary killer named Makala), the priest of the Silver Flame and his half-breed wingman vow to get her -- and countless other abductees -- back no matter what the cost. But the seafaring raiders are no ordinary criminals; they&#39;re led by the infamous vampire Onkar, who in turn serves a being unfathomably more evil than himself....</p><p></p><h2>Taming Chaos: Harnessing the Power of Kabbalah to Make Sense of Our Lives</h2><p>In this significant work, Kabbalist Rav Berg explains how readers can simply and easily tame the chaos in their lives with the tools found in the wisdom of the Kabbalah. According to the Kabbalah, chaos is not random, but rather, the result of an improper understanding of one's personal power and the spiritual system that can energize one's life. In truth, Berg notes, only human consciousness and the human mind can bring lasting order out of chaos. <i>Taming Chaos</i> offers an ancient methodology that provides access to a "bank" of positive energy designed to keep chaos at bay, even during the most unstable times. Drawing on the Kabbalah as a source of spiritual knowledge, Berg shows readers how to achieve self-improvement through spiritual realization.</p><p>Rav Berg was born August 20, 1927, in New York City. After many years of traditional religious study, he was ordained as a rabbi at Torah VaDaat. A businessman who wanted to make a difference in this world, he was always searching for his true path. Upon a chance meeting with Rav Yehuda Brandwein, Rav Berg knew he had found his teacher, and moved to Israel to study with Rav Brandwein at The Kabbalah Centre. After he returned to New York, Rav Berg maintained a written correspondence with Rav Brandwein who passed on his legacy as director of The Kabbalah Centre to Rav Berg. <p> Rav Berg made it his mission to continue editing, writing, printing, and distributing all that he learned from his teacher and began sharing the secrets of Kabbalah texts, which historically had been reserved for scholars. His book, Kabbalah for the Layman, was the revolutionary step that made Kabbalah accessible to every person. Rav Berg s other books include The Kabbalah Connection, Wheels of a Soul: Kabbalah and Reincarnation, To the Power of One, Energy of the Hebrew Letters, Immortality, Nano, The Kabbalah Method, Taming Chaos, and Education of a Kabbalist.</p><p> Together with his wife, Karen, Rav Berg opened the doors of The Kabbalah Centre to all who desire to learn this universal wisdom.

Inspired by images of individuals trying to survive while still holding on to their dignity, Appollo interweaves a poignant narrative that again and again rises to philosophy and poetry. Out of his narrative, one comes to many of the universal truths of poverty, truths that span cultures and time and which, following his analysis, can be seen in photograph after photograph. What Appollo finally produces is a moving social documentary about poverty on the streets, about police and power, and about middle class attitudes toward the destitute.</p><p>Ken Appollo is a dealer of antique photographic images. He is a legend among photography collectors, and this, his first book, represents a twenty-five year artistic gestation. <p>As a child, Appollo sold vegetables on the street; in youth he wandered the streets; and in adulthood, he followed the street in search of treasure. The images on these pages are collected evidence that simple trades between maker and user continued well beyond the advent of consuming masses in highly organized urban settings. They bear witness to the community of the street where neighbor knew neighbor, where the village cared for its less functional members, and where entertainment might erupt anytime just outside the door. The dancing bear and the organ grinder, the religious zealot and the ragpicker all found places on the street, traveling through villages, towns and cities, selling a little something in the marketplace of the humble.</p>Appollo, who calls himself a "street person," attempts to record street life during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with 61 photographs of street people accompanying his narrative. He asserts that people who earned their livelihood in the street performed a very necessary and interesting occupation in the general society. The author sees industrialization as destroying society's "safety net" by removing street vendors or legislating them out of existence. Appollo admits that his book is not intended to be an exhaustive historical work; indeed, it is lightweight as social commentary and all the more appealing for it.

Randolf Sontime is renowned for his personal charm, and Dr. Kramer is fighting to keep from falling victim to it. For the first time in her life, she truly understands the meaning of the word &#x201c;charisma.&#x201d; Not knowing that her own destiny is irrevocably tied to his, Anne Kramer listens to the story of Sontime&#x2019;s life.<br><br><i>&#x201c;It began with the magic, you see. And so, perforce, must I.&#x201d; </i>As a boy named Han at the House of Ra, an isolated oasis in the Egyptian desert of a far ancient time, Sontime lived in privilege. There the chosen were trained in the science of alchemy&#x2013;magic, philosophy, miracles. Only two other initiates were as skilled as he: Akan, quiet and studious, a boy whose thirst for knowledge was matched only by his hunger for truth; and Nefar, beautiful and brilliant, a girl as filled with wonder and unfathomable ambition as Han himself. Together they discovered that in union, theirs was a power unmatched in the physical world.<br><br>But even in the House of Ra, there were boundaries to be observed, knowledge that only the masters understood and feared. As the threesome&#x2019;s thirst for answers&#x2013;and for each other&#x2013;deepened, they were tempted by the dark arts that they had sworn to avoid. <i>&#x201c;Look at three magnificent youths who stand astride your world and scoff at the rules you must obey. . . .

In a stunning feat of unbridled imagination, Donna Boyd has created her most hypnotic novel to date.</p><p><b>Donna Boyd</b> lives in a restored turn-of-the-century barn in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where she is now working on her next novel.Imagine if you will the days spinning backward: a millennium ends here, a<br>century turns there, a year ends now, and another, and a thousand others,<br>and finally there are so many days, so many years ending and beginning<br>that you can no longer remember why <br>it seemed important that you keep count of them at all. And yet I have<br>counted them. I have counted every one, marking the beginning of each new<br>year, of each new century, in my own quiet fashion: a glass of wine,<br>perhaps, a silent toast. The world revolves, the view changes. Now I stand<br>atop a castle turret, now upon the deck of a sailing ship. Here I gaze<br>upon an ageless river, there a body-strewn battlefield; now I see the<br>dancing lights of the Champs d&#x2019;Elys�e, now I see the smoldering fires of a<br>fallen civilization. The years change, but the question does not. Will<br>this be it? I ask myself. Will this be the year I tell my story, the whole<br>of it, from beginning to end, at last?<br><br>And what a lovely entertainment it has been, all these thousands of<br>turning years, to imagine the telling, the circumstances of the telling,<br>and the reason for the telling. I have created the scenario and variations<br>upon scenario over and over again in my mind. Where to begin? How best to<br>glorify or debase myself in the telling, how to find the thread of truth<br>that, in the end, must be the summation of any man&#x2019;s life&#x2013;even if that<br>life has been as long and as tangled as mine. So now the time has come,<br>and the moment is&#x2013;as so many greatly anticipated moments<br>are&#x2013;disappointing. For I realized some time ago that the whole story<br>cannot be told, not today, perhaps not ever. Every man&#x2019;s life is simply a<br>sum of parts, and these are the only parts I can tell you now.<br><br>But the beginning, where was that? I think sometimes it began with a lithe<br>young girl of grand ambition and laughing eyes. At other times I am sure<br>it all started with the wistful longings of a poet-priest I once called<br>friend. Was it a woman&#x2019;s power, or a man&#x2019;s dreams? What dark god fashioned<br>this unlikely tale and sent it spinning into space with a single smiling<br>breath? And dare I think I ever, at any time, had any control over it at<br>all?<br><br>It began with the magic, you see. And so, perforce, must I.<br>I had a name in that long-ago time, but I have forgotten it centuries<br>since, so let me call myself as I was in those days: Han. Perhaps I had a<br>mother, a father, and an early family life but I do not recall those<br>either. Life began for me, as I remember it, in the House of Ra.<br><br>Much has been written in human history about this time in Egypt; entire<br>lifetimes have been dedicated to piecing together the scattered bones of<br>that long-ago life. As always, when what is shattered is reassembled with<br>no model to follow, mistakes will be made in the reconstruction, great<br>chunks, perhaps, will be missing and others will seem to have no place in<br>the whole at all. The result is, more often than not, a monstrous<br>grotesquerie.<br><br>So believe me when I tell you that, while historians have done a fair job<br>of reassembling the past, so much of what they have learned is only what<br>we wanted them to know, what was left for them to know. And nothing, I<br>assure you, of what you know or what you think you know of that time can<br>even begin to touch the truth of the House of Ra.<br><br>Truth is an interesting word. I cannot tell you now with absolute<br>certainty whether the structure itself, the temple complex in which we<br>lived and worked and ate and slept and studied was in fact composed of<br>mortar and stone, or whether it was merely an illusion of the same&#x2013;or,<br>most likely, a combination of both. I will describe it therefore as I<br>perceived it to be, remembering that in the end, in almost every instance,<br>the difference between truth and illusion is so faint as to be almost<br>inconsequential.<br><br>The House of Ra existed on a man-made oasis far from the banks of the<br>Nile, in a part of the Egyptian desert that is today a particularly brutal<br>and barren stretch of land in a place that is known for its inhospitable<br>nature. Soaring sandstone cliffs surrounded the oasis which, from the sky,<br>would be seen as an island of green in a sea of sand. Date and fig trees<br>grew side by side with banana, papaya, and orange trees. Waterfalls<br>tumbled from limestone boulders, formed deep pools and meandering streams.<br>The ground was covered with a lush low carpet of a fragrant creeping herb<br>that smelled like sweet lavender and felt like moss to the touch. Even<br>after all these years, I can but think of the House of Ra and that<br>fragrance will return to me. There is nothing like it growing in the world<br>today.<br><br>The temple complex was enormous&#x2013;larger, I think, than any of us imagined,<br>for it seemed the more we discovered, the more there was to discover.<br>There was a set of carved cypress doors at the entry to the temple, easily<br>two stories high, which were closed only on ceremonial occasions. The door<br>was inscribed with pictographs in the ancient language centered around the<br>symbol of our craft&#x2013;three interlocked globes in perfect balance that<br>formed the points of a triangle. When the doors were open, the triangle<br>was broken, leaving two globes joined and the one alone. Only when the<br>doors were closed was the triangle complete.<br><br>The complex itself was laid out like a triangle, with long straight<br>corridors containing classrooms, laboratories and sleeping areas, and<br>large circular common rooms at each apex of the triangle. The whole was<br>protected by a raised roof, so that indoor gardens and pools thrived in<br>the artificial tropical rain-forest atmosphere that had been created <br>by the designers. There were many levels, some labyrinthine, some so<br>compact they were practically claustrophobic, each with its own internal<br>environment&#x2013;cool in the heat of the sun and warm when the cold winds blew<br>across the desert.<br><br>Artificial light glowed from the walls and ceilings so that we might work<br>or study at night, and could be discontinued when we wished it.<br>Refrigeration was available, but rarely used, as our supply of fresh foods<br>was abundant. Our clothing was manufactured so quickly and inexpensively<br>that there was no need for laundering, and our food was cooked with a<br>method that used no fuel and gave off no heat. We bathed in warm-water<br>pools and used an internal, automated waste-disposal system. We had, in<br>this ancient, long-forgotten desert temple, every modern convenience.<br><br>The House of Ra was a secret over two thousand years old even when I was<br>there. Within those vaulted marble halls and sun-drenched galleries, magic<br>met science, philosophy met truth, wonders and miracles were merely a<br>matter of course. Years later a library would be built in Alexandria that<br>would become known as the greatest in the world; it was only a shallow<br>replica of the library contained in the vaults of the House of Ra. There<br>were never more than thirteen initiates at a time; the best and the<br>brightest of all of Egypt, hand-chosen by the Masters to live at the<br>temple and study the truths.<br><br>And what truths were those? Ah, you could spend a lifetime and still not<br>list them all. The nature of atomic particles and the nature of man, the<br>composition of chemical alloys and the mysteries of the soul. The<br>transmutation of matter, the source of all Power. To live in truth, and to<br>practice deception. Magic. Medicine. Discipline. Mastery. Good and evil.<br>Balance in all things.<br><br>We were chosen at a young age, male and female, for characteristics not<br>even our parents could identify, and from that time until we gained<br>adulthood we knew no life outside the House of Ra. It was, to the best of<br>my recollection, a very ordinary life: we played, we studied, we ate and<br>slept; we had childish spats with our classmates, we were impertinent to<br>our teachers. We had moments of great joy and deep pain, of triumph and<br>failure and enlightenment and humiliation. We grew, we learned, we loved.<br>We formed loyal friendships and casual sexual liaisons. There was nothing<br>special about us, at least in our own view. We lived in the same universe<br>that you do today; we simply learned to operate that universe according to<br>a different set of rules.<br><br>Yet I don&#x2019;t mean to minimize the grandeur of our time there; the majesty<br>of what we were becoming. Even now I have but to close my eyes and it will<br>return to me with breathless, aching wonder, the first time I understood<br>the workings of this world and the power I had over it. Let me speak the<br>words, with proper tone and rhythm, choosing the syllables and the harmony<br>they produce, let me hold the thought and say the spell, and what once was<br>is no longer so. Watch me now as I pluck from the air the electricity that<br>sparks from my fingers, for don&#x2019;t you know it was always there? And now<br>with an outstretched arm I will lift that stone with the strength of my<br>intent, and see how it floats like a feather in the air! Let me touch your<br>hand and rewrite your memory. Let me bind you with my eyes, let me whisper<br>your name and capture your will. We were dealers in magic, and magic ruled<br>the world.<br><br>I have said we, but it is important to know that not all who studied at<br>the House of Ra were of equal ability. Some would never do more than<br>master the principles of physics and chemistry that would enable them to<br>control the environment in which we must live; others might dip their<br>fingers into the stream of the human unconscious and come away with a<br>basic understanding of the arcane laws that govern existence here on<br>earth. The study of the Art was intensely personal, and we competed<br>against no one but ourselves.<br><br>But there were three of us who, from the beginning, excelled above the<br>others at the Practice. We couldn&#x2019;t help noticing. And we couldn&#x2019;t stop,<br>no matter how we disciplined our minds, the thread of ambition from<br>snaking into our days. It was inevitable, I suppose, that that ambition<br>should bring us into conflict. But even we would not have sought conflict<br>within the mastery of one of the most dangerous and complex of all the<br>mystic arts&#x2013;nor could we have guessed how deeply, in the end, it would<br>bind us together.<br>It is quite one thing to perform the mysteries on inanimate objects, to<br>cause boulders to melt into lava, to dry up a stream with the force of<br>one&#x2019;s breath, for it is well-known that all things exist in all forms at<br>all times; it&#x2019;s merely a matter of learned skills to shift them from one<br>state into another. But to transform oneself&#x2013;that is the thing that will<br>tempt and terrify every Practitioner, in one form or another, for as long<br>as he lives. Many an adept, quite competent in all other areas, will never<br>achieve the state of simple Oneness that is necessary to become another<br>living being. But for the three of us, in that long-ago time in the House<br>of Ra, the gift came easily. Perhaps too easily.<br><br>There has been much debate over the millennia as to whether this<br>transformation was a literal, physical transmutation of matter, or an<br>equally literal, but far less demonstrable, transfiguration of spirit. Did<br>I become the frog, or did I merely cast my consciousness into the essence<br>of frog-ness, and did I do it with such power and conviction as to cause<br>others to see me as I saw myself&#x2013;in the form of a frog? I tell you now it<br>is one and the same. All magic is illusion, and all reality is only what<br>one perceives it to be, and in the world in which we lived the line<br>between these two planes of existence was so faint as to be almost<br>invisible.<br><br>So if it will help your modern, Western-scientific mind to accept more<br>easily the occurrences I describe, believe if you will that it was merely<br>a function of the occult mind. That we imagined, and caused others to<br>imagine, those things that seem impossible for you to believe. I&#x2019;ll not<br>argue the point. Imagination can stop a heart, you know, or break a bone,<br>or alter the face of time, and in the end it is all the same to those<br>whose lives are affected.<br><br>Still, I should not wish you to think that it was a casual thing, this<br>shedding of one form to become another, or that it might be summoned at<br>random will. Quite the contrary. Most of us will never master anything<br>more than simple animal forms&#x2013;the frog, the fish, the bird or snake. Ah,<br>but to attain transmutation to any form was a wonder almost too exquisite<br>to bear; so intensely involving was it, so deeply, singularly pleasurable,<br>that there was a real danger in giving oneself over to it so completely<br>that one lost all desire to change back, and soon forgot how. Our history<br>is rich with tales of such unfortunate occurrences: the prince trapped in<br>the form of a frog, the lovers transformed into swans, the virgin who<br>changed herself into a tree&#x2013;and neglected to change back. Oh, believe me,<br>I know the temptation. I know the pain of choice.</p><h2>Georgie</h2><p>Out of print for over a decade, two standouts from the bewitching Georgie the ghost series are available again. In Georgie (1944), readers are introduced to the gentle little ghost, who happily haunts Mr. and Mrs. Whittaker's house -- creaking the loose board on the stairs and giving the parlor door a little squeak every night -- until his world is turned topsy-turvy and he must find a new house to haunt. <br></p><p>Grownups will shiver with delight when they recognize this old favorite. Georgie the mild-mannered little ghost has been around for over half a century, his gentle ways happily haunting generations of children. Georgie is quite content with his quiet routine in the home of the Whittakers. Every evening he creaks a loose board on the stairs and squeaks the parlor door. This is the cue for Mr. and Mrs. Whittaker to go to bed, Herman the cat to start to prowl, and Miss Oliver the owl to wake up and hoot. But one day when Mr. Whittaker gets a notion in his head to nail down the creaky step and oil the squeaky door, suddenly everything changes. Poor Georgie can no longer perform his ghostly duties, and must leave home to find a new haunt. But will he find happiness? Robert Bright's deep-blue ink drawings provide a spooky tone that pleasantly belies Georgie's friendly nature. We're delighted to see this well-loved classic of the pleasures of home sweet home back in print.

But in 1954 a local fisherman is found suspiciously drowned, and a Japanese American named Kabuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Pedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries--memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched. Gripping, tragic, and densely atmospheric, <b>Snow Falling on Cedars</b> is a masterpiece of suspense-- one that leaves us shaken and changed.</p></p><h2>In the Spirit of Martin: The Living Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</h2><p>In the Spirit of Martin is the companion book to the first museum exhibition -- opening in January 2002 at the Smithsonian Institution -- to demonstrate the compelling outpouring of responses to Dr. King&#x2019;s life.

For the new 2002 definitive softcover edition Brown has designed new layouts for the entire book, using "white" panel backgrounds instead of the black pages of the first edition.</p></p><p>If you ever doubted that a comic book could wrench your heart, I urge you to read <i>I Never Liked You.</i> Chester Brown looks back on his adolescent attempts at relationships--with his friends, his mother, the girl who always loved him--with such maturity and understatement that the result is an unspoken testament to the reality of life. The feeling you're left with after reading this comic is due in part to the skilled, reserved hand of Brown the artist: his comics flow so smoothly through time that once begun, this book is almost impossible to put down. The panels--often a tiny single frame on a page of pure black--convey such a sense of loneliness that in any other medium this story wouldn't be half as good.Chester Brown is commonly regarded as one of the leading figures of the alternative comics "renaissance" that began in the 1980's.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cartoonist, he has produced three regular comic book series, <i>Yummy Fur</i>, <i>Underwater</i>, and <i>Louis Riel</i>, and his work has been collected in four books: <i>Ed The Happy Clown</i>, <i>The Playboy</i>, <i> I Never Liked You</i>, and <i>The Little Man</i>.&nbsp;Throughout his career, Brown's work has been known for its diverse and unpredictable nature. His stories have ranged from the absurd surrealism of <i>Ed the Happy Clown</i>, to the deeply personal, understated autobiographical accounts of his youth, to, more recently, the dada-esque, linguistically-challenged oddness of <i>Underwater</i>. Brown has won two Harvey Awards, for Best Cartoonist and Best Graphic Album</p><h2>Small-Batch Baking</h2><p><i>Small-Batch Baking</i> is how to have your cake, and eat it all too.

Michael Straczynski - Volume 1</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Warhost of Vastmark (Ships of Merior/Janny Wurts, Vol 2)</h2><p>The Mistwraith's curse of vengeance has locked two princes into an ever deeper pattern of enmity. Since the deception and betrayal which ended <em>Ships of Merior,</em> their struggle has widened to encompass the fates of the world. <p> Lysaer, Prince of Light--committed to serving justice, deeply bitter over the total destruction of his fleet, he lacks the means to transport his vast warhost, but swears he will still capture Arithon, defenseless in his shipyard at the seaside village of Merior... </p><p> Arithon, Master of Shadow--set back since the fire which has damaged the vessels he built to escape into freedom, he has no choice but to attempt the impossible: to so one ship launched before Lysaer's warhost can corner him, or to raise up a counterforce and meet on a field at a ruinous cost in bloodshed.</p></p><p><p>Janny Wurts is the author of eleven novels, a collection of short stories, and the internationally best selling Empire trilogy written in collaboration with Raymond E. Feist. Her current release in her Wars of Light and Shadow series, Grand Conspiracy, and her forthcoming hardcover, Peril's Gate, are the culmination of more than twenty years of carefully evolved ideas. The cover images on the books, both in the US and abroad, are her own paintings, depicting her vision of characters and setting.</p><p>Through her combined talents as a writer/illustrator, Janny has immersed herself in a lifelong ambition: to create a seamless interface between words and pictures that will lead reader and viewer beyond the world we know. Her lavish use of language lures the mind into a crafted realm of experience, with characters and events woven into a complex tapestry, and drawn with an intensity to leave a lasting impression. Her research includes a range of direct experience, lending her fantasy a gritty realism, and her scenes involving magic an almost visionary credibility. A self&#x2013;taught painter, she draws directly from the imagination, creating scenes in a representational style that blurs the edges between dream and reality. She makes no preliminary sketches, but envisions her characters and the scenes that contain them, then executes the final directly from the initial pencil drawing.</p><p>The seed idea for the Wars of Light and Shadow series occurred, when, in the course of researching tactic and weapons, she viewed a documentary film on the Battle of Culloden Moor. This was the first time she had encountered the historical context of that brutal event, with the embroidery of romance stripped from it. The experience gave rise to an awakening, which became anger, that so often, our education, literature and entertainment slant history in a manner that equates winners and losers with moral right and wrong, and the prevalent attitude, that killing wars can be seen as justifiable solutions when only one side of the picture is presented. </p><p>Her series takes the stance that there are two sides to every question, and follows two characters who are half brothers. One a bard trained as a master of magecraft, and the other a born ruler with a charismatic passion for justice, have become cursed to lifelong enmity. As one sibling raises a devoted mass following, the other tries desperately to stave off defeat through solitary discipline and cleverness. The conflict sweeps across an imaginary world, dividing land and people through an intricate play of politics and the inborn prejudices of polarized factions already set at odds. Readers are led on a journey that embraces both viewpoints. The story explores the ironies of morality which often confound our own human condition-that what appears right and just, by one side, becomes reprehensible when seen from the opposite angle. What is apparently good for the many, too often causes devastating suffering to the nonconformist minority. Through the interactions between the characters themselves, the reader is left to their own discretion to interpret the moral impact of events. </p><p>Says Janny of her work, "I chose to frame this story against a backdrop of fantasy because I could handle even the most sensitive issues with the gloves off-explore the myriad angles of our troubled times with the least risk of offending anyone's personal sensibilities. The result, I can hope, is an expanding journey of the spirit that explores the grand depths, and rises to the challenge of mapping the ethereal potential of an evolving planetary consciousness." </p><p>Beyond writing, Janny's award winning paintings have been showcased in exhibitions of imaginative artwork, among them a commemorative exhibition for NASA's 25th Anniversary; the Art of the Cosmos at Hayden Planetarium in New York; and two exhibits of fantasy art, at both the Delaware Art Museum, and Canton Art Museum.</p><p>&#x2018;Astonishingly original and compelling&#x2019; Raymond E.

He gives the wheat: we must reap and grind and bake it." -Evelyn Underhill <br>In these two classics, British poet and mystic Evelyn Underhill shows herself to be one of the most authoritative modern voices on mysticism. Written on the eve of World War I," Practical Mysticism reviews the works of the greatest Western mystics, including Teresa of Avila, Julian of Norwich, and Thomas a Kempis. Underhill's goal is to guide her readers on a journey toward mystical consciousness, to teach them to see the "eternal beauty beyond and beneath apparent ruthlessness."" Abba, first published in 1940, takes as its starting point the seven phrases of the Lord's Prayer, using them as a means to propel the self toward union with God. In these important works, Underhill brings an often esoteric subject onto a practical footing, showing that the profound gifts of mysticism are not only for the few but are within reach of us all.Evelyn Underhill was the 20th century&#39;s most authoritative voice on mysticism. Poet, author, and lecturer, she played an instrumental role in defining the western spiritual path.</p><h2>Discovering the History of Your House and Your Neighborhood</h2><p><b>Every home has a story to tell!</b> Whether you own an elaborate Victorian, cozy bungalow or cottage, ranch style, or are part of a newer subdivision, your house and property have a unique history that is just waiting to be uncovered.<br><br>Part treasure hunt and part jigsaw puzzle, researching the history of your house is a fascinating and rewarding experience.

She has taught house history research at adult educational programs throughout the Chicago area, and has written nominations to list buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. Green also regularly presents programs to libraries, historical societies, and community groups.Most homeowners probably haven't given much thought to who owned their homes two or three generations ago, or what color they were, or whether they once had different street addresses. House historian Green, on the other hand, believes that every older home should have a complete and detailed record of its previous owners, architectural modifications, and history. If you're keen to become an architectural detective, this intriguing book will get you started. Useful tips abound: if, for instance, you're looking for old photographs of your home, and you live on a main thoroughfare, check out photos of parades that might have passed by; if you're looking for information on previous owners, make sure to check for variant spellings of their surname in the relevant documents. In addition, the author steers us toward the right government offices and the appropriate library resources. There's no doubt that this is a special-interest book with a limited audience, but wouldn't it be nice to have a copy on your shelves the next time a would-be house detective asks for help? <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In <i>Vermeer in Bosnia</i>, whether he is reporting on the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars (and noticing, for example, how centuries earlier Vermeer had had to invent the peace and serenity we so prize in his work today from a youth during which all of Europe had been as ravaged as Bosnia) or dissecting the special quality of light in his beloved hometown of Los Angeles, Weschler&#x2019;s perceptions are often startling, his insights both fresh and profound.<br><br>Included here is Weschler&#x2019;s remarkable profile of Roman Polanski&#x2013;written years before the release of The Pianist, yet all but predicting the director&#x2019;s confrontation with the Holocaust in that film&#x2013;alongside an equally celebrated portrait of Ed Weinberger, a young designer crushed and yet hardly bowed by an extreme form of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.

Here is Weschler on Art Spiegelman, David Hockney, Ed Kienholz, and Wislawa Szymborska.<br><br>Here, in short, are some of the most dazzling pieces from Lawrence Weschler&#x2019;s own brimming cabinet of marvels.</p><p>Until his recent retirement, Lawrence Weschler was for more than twenty years a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>, where his work shuttled between political tragedies and cultural comedies.

While there, I had occasion to talk with some of the principal figures involved in this unprecedented judicial undertaking.<br><br>At one point, for instance, I was having lunch with Antonio Cassese, a distinguished Italian jurist who has been serving for the past two years as the president of the court (the head of its international panel of eleven judges). He'd been rehearsing for me some of the more gruesome stories that have crossed his desk-maybe not the most gruesome but just the sort of thing he has to contend with every day and which perhaps accounts for the sense of urgency he brings to his mission. The story, for instance, of a soccer player. As Cassese recounted, "Famous guy, a Muslim. When he was captured, they said, 'Aren't you So-and-So?' He admitted he was. So they broke both his legs, handcuffed him to a radiator, and forced him to watch as they repeatedly raped his wife and two daughters and then slit their throats. After that, he begged to be killed himself, but his tormentors must have realized that the cruelest thing they could possibly do to him now would simply be to set him free, which they did. Somehow, this man was able to make his way to some U.N. investigators, and told them about his ordeal-a few days after which, he committed suicide." Or, for instance, as Cassese went on, "some of the tales about Tadic himself, how, in addition to the various rapes and murders he's accused of, he is alleged to have supervised the torture and torments of a particular group of Muslim prisoners, at one point forcing one of his charges to emasculate another-with his teeth. The one fellow died, and the guy who bit him went mad."<br><br>Stories like that: one judge's daily fare. And, at one point, I asked Judge Cassese how, regularly obliged to gaze into such an appalling abyss, he had kept from going mad himself. His face brightened. "Ah," he said with a smile. "You see, as often as possible I make my way over to the Mauritshuis museum, in the center of town, so as to spend a little time with the<br><br>Vermeers."<br><br>Sitting there over lunch with Cassese, I'd been struck by the perfect aptness of his impulse. I, too, had been spending time with the Vermeers at the Mauritshuis, and at the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam, as well. For Vermeer's paintings, almost uniquely in the history of art, radiate "a centeredness, a peacefulness, a serenity" (as Cassese put it), a sufficiency, a sense of perfectly equipoised grace. In his exquisite Study of Vermeer, Edward Snow has deployed as epigraph a line from Andrew Forge's essay "Painting and the Struggle for the Whole Self," which reads, "In ways that I do not pretend to understand fully, painting deals with the only issues that seem to me to count in our benighted time-freedom, autonomy, fairness, love." And I've often found myself agreeing with Snow's implication that somehow these issues may be more richly and fully addressed in Vermeer than anywhere else.<br><br>But that afternoon with Cassese I had a sudden further intuition as<br><br>to the true extent of Vermeer's achievement-something I hadn't fully grasped before. For, of course, when Vermeer was painting those images, which for us have become the very emblem of peacefulness and serenity, all Europe was Bosnia (or had only just recently ceased to be): awash in incredibly vicious wars of religious persecution and proto-nationalist formation, wars of an at-that-time unprecedented violence and cruelty, replete with sieges and famines and massacres and mass rapes, unspeakable tortures and wholesale devastation. To be sure, the sense of Holland during Vermeer's lifetime which we are usually given-that of the country's so-called Golden Age-is one of becalmed, burgherlike efficiency; but that Holland, to the extent that it ever existed, was of relatively recent provenance, and even then under a continual threat of being overwhelmed once again.<br><br>Jan Vermeer was born in 1632, sixteen years before the end of the Thirty Years' War, which virtually shredded neighboring Germany and repeatedly tore into the Netherlands as well. Between 1652 and 1674, England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands went to war three times, and though most of the fighting was confined to sea battles, the wars were not without their consequences for the Dutch mainland: Vermeer's Delft, in particular, suffered terrible devastation in 1654, when some eighty thousand pounds of gunpowder in the town's arsenal accidentally exploded, killing hundreds, including Vermeer's great contemporary, the painter Carel Fabritius. (By the conclusion of those wars, the Dutch had ended up ceding New Amsterdam to the British, who quickly changed its name to New York.) These were years of terrible religious conflict throughout Europe-the climaxes of both the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation and their various splintering progeny. And though the Dutch achieved an enviable atmosphere of tolerance during this period, Holland was regularly overrun with refugees from religious conflicts elsewhere. (Vermeer himself, incidentally, was a convert to Catholicism, which was a distinctly minority creed in the Dutch context.) Finally, in 1672, the Dutch fell under the murderous assault of France's Louis XIV and were subjected to a series of campaigns that lasted until 1678. In fact, the ensuing devastation of the Dutch economy and Vermeer's own resulting bankruptcy may have constituted a proximate cause of the painter's early death, by stroke, in 1675: he was only forty-two.<br><br>Another preliminary session of the Tribunal was scheduled for late in the afternoon of the day I had lunch with Judge Cassese, and, following our conversation, I decided to spend the intervening hours at the Mauritshuis. On the taxi ride out, as I looked through a Vermeer catalogue, I began to realize that, in fact, the pressure of all that violence (remembered, imagined, foreseen) is what those paintings are all about. Of course, not directly-in fact, quite the opposite: the literary critic Harry Berger, in his essays on Vermeer, frequently invokes the notion of the "conspicuous exclusion" of themes that are saturatingly present but only as felt absence-themes that are being held at bay, but conspicuously so. It's almost as if Vermeer can be seen, amid the horrors of his age, to have been asserting or inventing the very idea of peace. But Hobbes's state of nature, or state of war (Hobbes: 1588-1679; Vermeer: 1632-75), is everywhere adumbrated around the edges of Vermeer's achievement. That's what the roaring lions carved into the chair posts are all about-those and also the maps on the wall. The maps generally portray the Netherlands, but the whole point is that during Vermeer's lifetime the political and geographic dispensation of the Netherlands, the distribution of its Protestants and Catholics, the grim legacy of its only just recently departed Spanish overlords, and the still<br><br>current threats posed by its English and French neighbors-all these matters were still actively, and sometimes bloodily, being contested. When soldiers visit young girls in Vermeer's paintings, where does one think they have been off soldiering-and why, one wonders, does the country need all those civic guards? When pregnant young women are standing still, bathed in the window light, intently reading those letters, where is one invited to imagine the letters are coming from?<br><br>Or consider the magisterial View of Delft-as I now did, having arrived at the Mauritshuis and taken a seat before the magnificent canvas up on the second floor. It is an image of unalloyed civic peace and quiet. But it is also the image of a town only just emerging from a downpour, the earth in the foreground still saturated with moisture, the walls of the town bejeweled with wet, the dark clouds breaking up at last, and the sunlight breaking through, though not just anywhere: a shaft of fresh, clean light gets lavished on one spire in particular, that of the radiantly blond Nieuwe Kerk, in whose interior, as any contemporary of Vermeer's would doubtless have known, stands the mausoleum of William the Silent, one of the heroes of the wars of Dutch independence, assassinated in Delft at the end of the previous century by a French Catholic fanatic.<br><br>I found myself being reminded of a moment in my own life, over twenty-five years ago. I was in college and Nixon had just invaded Cambodia and we were, of course, all up in arms; the college had convened as a committee of the whole in the dining commons-the students, the professors, the administrators-what were we going to do? How were we going to respond? Our distinguished American history professor got up and declared this moment the crisis of American history. Not to be outdone, our eminent new-age classicist got up and declared it the crisis of universal history. And we all nodded our fervent concurrence. But then our visiting religious historian from England-a tall, lanky lay-Catholic theologian,<br><br>as it happened, with something of the physical bearing of Abraham<br><br>Lincoln-got up and suggested mildly, "We really ought to have a little modesty in our crises. I suspect," he went on, "that the people during the Black Plague must have thought they were in for a bit of a scrape."<br><br>Having momentarily lanced our fervor, he went on to allegorize, deploying the story of Jesus on the Waters (from Matthew 8:23-27). "Jesus," he reminded us, "needed to get across the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, so they all boarded a small boat, whereupon Jesus quickly fell into a nap. Presently a storm kicked up, and the disciples, increasingly edgy, finally woke Jesus up. He told them not to worry, everything would be all right, whereupon he fell back into his na...</p><h2>Dori Sanders&#39; Country Cooking: Recipes and Stories from the Family Farm Stand</h2><p>Here is a book as delightful to read as it is to cook from. Dori Sanders&#39; recipes include not only new interpretations of old-time favorites such as Spoon Bread, Chicken and Dumplings, Corn Bread, and Buttermilk Biscuits, but also her &#34;Cooking for Northerners&#34;--original dishes such as Winter Greens Parmesan, Roasted Mild Peppers, Fresh Vegetable Stew--and, of course, great recipes for peaches. A Literary Guild and a Rodale Press Book Club selection.</p><p><p>Dori Sanders was born in York County, South Carolina. Her father&#x2019;s farm, where her family still raises Georgia Belle and Alberta peaches, is one of the oldest black-owned farms in York County. In the growing season she farms the family land, cultivating peaches, watermelons, and vegetables, and helps staff Sanders&#x2019; Peach Shed, her family&#x2019;s farmstand. <i>Clover, </i>her first novel, was followed by the novel <i>Her Own Place </i>and a cookbook, <i>Dori Sanders&#x2019; Country Cooking.&nbsp;</i></p>Each of these authors offers a different perspective on Southern cooking, but all are determined to clear up some misconceptions about the food that is their heritage. And although little has been written until now about the African contribution to Southern cooking, these books make apparent the tremendous effect of slave cooks on the food of the South. Fowler, an architect-turned-food writer and cooking teacher, went back to the "golden age" of Southern cooking to refute those myths about pork fat and overcooked vegetables. The authors of four cookbooks published in the mid-1800s became his main resources, and with those women as guides, he has written an authoritative and fascinating cookbook and culinary history. Most of his recipes come from early cookbooks, with generous excerpts from their texts; all have been adapted if necessary for modern kitchens: Celery Bisque with Oysters, Fresh Pork with Sage, Annabella Hill's Stewed Tomatoes. Fowler has strong opinions but a sense of humor as well, and his narrative is absorbing; his cookbook/ reference is highly recommended. Novelist Sanders (Her Own Place, LJ 3/15/93) was raised on one of the oldest black-owned farms in South Carolina, near where she and some of her nine brothers and sisters run their farm and now-famous farmstand. Her homey recipes?e.g., Fresh Corn and Tomato Stew, Cantaloupe Peach Conserve?are organized around family stories and events. Sanders has a sly sense of humor, and her observations make engrossing reading. Recommended for most collections. Low-fat soul food may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Carter, a journalist who writes about health, shows there's more to the cooking she grew up on than cream gravies and bacon grease. She includes many recipes from her great-grandmother and grandfather, two of her greatest culinary influences, along with her mother and grandmother?Codfish Cakes, Cucumbers in Peppered Vinegar, Old-Fashioned Biscuits?as well as other Southern specialties and her own more upscale creations. She has lightened some traditional dishes, and while some may prefer to stick to the real thing, there are still lots of good recipes here.

Perennial favorites--such as "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," "The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids," and "The Gingerbread Man"--are retold by award-winning author Geraldine McCaughrean. There is plenty of fun and humor in these new retellings, specifically designed for this very young age group, yet the author never loses sight of the traditional shape and feel of the original classics. The illustrations by Robina Green are a delight--finely detailed and handsomely colored, they recreate the imaginary world of the fairy tale with all its magical power. <br><br> [excerpt] "'Drat,' said the Wolf and went away.<br> He went to the shop and bought a stick of chalk and ate it. It made his voice not rough and tough, but soft and smooth, and back he went to Goat Cottage.<br> He knocked on the door; rat-tat.<br> 'Who's there?'<br> The wolf put his paws on the window-sill and bleated, 'Children, children, open the door. It's your own little mother and I've brought seven presents, one for each of you. Open the door, do.'"<br> <br> (from "The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids")</p><p><br><strong>Geraldine McCaughrean</strong> is an acclaimed children's writer, whose books include <em>The Random Children's Book of Stories from the Ballet</em> and <em>My First Oxford Book of Stories</em>, as well as classic retellings of <em>Moby Dick, The Canterbury Tales</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em>.<br>Twelve chestnuts in standard versions, lightly massaged by McCaughrean (Grandma Chickenlegs, 1999, etc.) and illustrated with plenty of small, finely detailed vignettes. The body count is relatively low: the Big Bad Wolf survives his encounter with Little Red Riding Hood, and sneezes out the six little kids; the first two Little Pigs escape when their houses are blown down; and the Third Billy Goat Gruff merely tosses the troll so high that he takes three days to come down. Similarly, young viewers will not actually see the Gingerbread Boy being eaten, or the wolf marinating in the Third Little Pig's pot. Happily, the occasional vivid image--the string of villagers trailing willy-nilly behind the Golden Goose are all glued as close together as the letters in a word--or turn of phrase gives the tales a few sparks of spontaneity, the Little Red Hen eats the loaf all by herself in this version, and the witch who loans the magic porridge pot turns out to be a merry sort--Just my little joke, she croaks, giggling at the sight of dried porridge on the local steeple. Judy Sierra's Nursery Tales From Around the World (1996) draws from a wider range of traditions, and many collections, led by Anne Rockwell's Three Bears and 15 Other Stories (1975), are larger gatherings, but this makes a suitable, if conventional, choice for adults searching for a fresh gathering of the perennials to share with younger children.

Whether praiseful or interrogating, When We Were Birds is a book of flight, light, and song. "When we were birds," Wilkins begins, "we veered &amp; wheeled, we flapped &amp; looped-- / it's true, we flew."</p><p>Joe Wilkins is the author of the memoir <i>The Mountain and the Fathers</i> and the poetry collections <i>Notes from the Journey Westward</i> and <i>Killing the Murnion Dogs</i>. A Pushcart Prize winner and National Magazine Award finalist, he lives in western Oregon and teaches writing at Linfield College.&#34;When We Were Birds possesses the kind of vision and verve reserved for those who have a hallowed conception of our journey on earth. I cannot recall such a book in recent memory that has me read with such careful attention to my breathing or reminded me of the aliveness of poetry in our age. Reading When We Were Birds leaves me hankering for the complex richness of our shared humanity, which I secretly think is Wilkins&#39;s great agenda for his art, and nothing less.&#34; -Major Jackson, Citation for the Stafford/Hall Prize from the Oregon Book Awards</p><h2>Fortress Europe: Dispatches from a Gated Continent</h2><p>On the militarized Turkish-Greek border, Afghan migrants brave minefields to cross into Europe&#x2014;only to be summarily ejected by Greek border guards. At Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves in North Africa, migrants are turned back with razor wire and live ammunition. Deportees from the U.K. and France have died of "positional asphyxia" on deportation flights, strapped to chairs, their mouths sealed with tape. In a brilliant and shocking account, <i>Fortress Europe</i> tells the story of how the world&#x2019;s most affluent region&#x2014;and history&#x2019;s greatest experiment with globalization&#x2014;has become an immigration war zone, where tens of thousands have died in a human rights crisis that has gone largely unnoticed by the U.S. media.<br><br>Journalist Matthew Carr brings to life these remarkable human dramas, based on extensive interviews and firsthand reporting from the hot zones of Europe&#x2019;s immigration battles. Speaking with key European policy makers, police, soldiers on the front lines, immigrant rights activists, and an astonishing range of migrants themselves, Carr offers a lucid account both of the broad issues at stake in the crisis and its exorbitant human costs.</p><p><b>Matthew Carr</b> is a writer, broadcaster, journalist, and the author of <i>Blood and Faith: The Purging of Muslim Spain</i> (a <i>New York Times</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice), <i>The Infernal Machine: A History of Terrorism</i>, and the acclaimed memoir <i>My Father&#x2019;s House</i>.

In full pursuit of the good life-- boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies--he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him . . . and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn&#39;t help. Despite himself, Travis can&#39;t stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, THE CHOICE ultimately confronts us with the most heartwrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?</p><p>Nicholas Sparks is the author of the #1 New York Times bestsellers The Rescue and Nights in Rodanthe, as well as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, A Walk to Remember, A Bend in the Road, The Guardian, The Wedding, and his moving memoir, Three Weeks with My Brother, written with his brother, Micah. All his books were New York Times and international bestsellers translated into more than thirty languages, and Message in a Bottle, A Walk to Remember, and The Notebook were adapted into major motion pictures. Nicholas Sparks lives in North Carolina with his wife and family.Holter Graham gives a polished performance with his versatile skills and vocal range as he embraces the roles of Travis Parker, local veterinarian, and Gabby Holland, physician�s assistant. In Part One, Graham captures the exquisite story of their attraction, love, and marriage with a warmth and rhythm that breathes life into the characters. Ten years later in Part Two, Graham portrays Travis�s torment when Gabby falls into a coma after a car accident that is his fault. As Gabby fails to recover, Graham captures Travis�s conflict over a decision he must make--a decision based on a promise Gabby extracted from him before her life took its tragic turn.

As Marco journeys from the canyons of Manhattan to the deserts of Utah, he encounters a gallery of characters and a series of events as rich and surprising as any in modern fiction.<p> Beginning during the summer that men first walked on the moon, and moving backward and forward in time to span three generations, <b>Moon Palace</b> is propelled by coincidence and memory, and illuminated by marvelous flights of lyricism and wit. Here is the most entertaining and moving novel yet from an author well known for his breathtaking imagination.</p></p><p>Paul Auster is the best-selling author of Invisible, Moon Palace, Mr Vertigo, The Brooklyn Follies, The Book of Illusions and The New York Trilogy, among many other works. In 2006 he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize for Literature and inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.Among his other honours are the Independent Spirit Award for the screenplay of Smoke and the Prix Medicis Etranger for Leviathan. He has also been short-listed for both the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award (The Book of Illusions) and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction (The Music of Chance). His work has been translated into more than thirty languages.He lives in Brooklyn, New York."It was the summer that men first walked on the moon. I was very young back then, but I did not believe there would ever be a future." Yet this novel deals precisely with the future that protagonist Marco Stanley Fogg seems to doubt the most: his own. We see Marco through several quite remarkable years, during which he nearly starves himself to death out of poverty and dejection, is rescued by a beautiful Chinese girl named Kitty Wu, and ends up as the live-in helper to an invalid old man, the recording of whose life story becomes Marco's obsession and the focus of the novel. Indeed, the old man's tale eventually becomes Marco's, spiraling into one big center where everything and everyone is (literally!) related. The novel's fantastic quality can be hard to swallow, and some of the action is maddeningly distant, but it's interesting, worthwhile reading.<br><i>- Jessica Grim, NYPL</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Great Courses How to Look at and Understand Great Art #7640 - Set of 2 Transcript Books</h2><p>Softcover- two volumes in New condition unopened in plastic wrap</p><p></p><h2>Man&#39;s Hope (An Evergreen Book) (English and French Edition)</h2><p>The tragedy of the Spanish Civil War serves as a basis for exploring the human condition in this novel which captures the torture, fear, and bravery of the romantic hero who deeply believes in the rebel cause and enters into the fighting</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Finity&#39;s End</h2><p>Finity&#39;s End is the oldest Merchanter ship in the universe.

For Captain Neihart is forging a treaty among the worlds, stations and Merchanters; and opponents will try ambush, sabotage, and murder to stop him. By journey's end the hope for peace will depend on whether JR, Jeremy and the crew can uphold Merchanter honor; and whether Fletcher, guided by a gift from the hisa, can learn to trust... and find his true place in the universe.</p></p><h2>Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Compact Edition</h2><p>The classic, best-selling Zondervan NIV Study Bible, completely revised and updated in 2002, in a compact, easy-to-carry size with two smart, durable binding choices&#x2014;Zondervan&#x2019;s new Italian Duo-Tone&#x2122; binding.</p><p></p><h2>All Truth Is God&#39;s Truth</h2><p>To understand the Christian view of Truth</p><p></p><h2>A Stone, a Leaf, a Door: Poems</h2><p>Book by Wolfe, Thomas</p><p></p><h2>The Joy of Worry</h2><p>Stressed out?

He now lives and worries in Pennsylvania.<br><br>Roz Chast's illustrations have appeared anxiously in the New Yorker since 1978."Worry is fear harnessed to imagination." With this brilliant re-definition of an old bugaboo, Weiner begins this perfectly pitched spoof of the lifestyle how-to. The New Yorker and National Lampoon writer "has been apprehensive most of his life," notes his publisher, thus he knows whereof he writes. The "motivational" text is accompanied by sidebars delineating types of worry (fretting, brooding, etc.) and the number of calories burned by worrying about particular things (e.g., 311 calories burned for worrying about destruction of the ozone layer). You can, Weiner shows, worry your way to wealth and health, not to mention happiness.

Gene Wolfe's first novel consists of three linked sections, all of them elegant broodings on identity, sameness, and strangeness, and all of them set on the vividly evoked colony worlds of Ste. Croix and Ste. Anne, twin planets delicately poised in mutual orbit. <p>Marsch, the victim in the third story, is the apparent author of the second and a casual visitor whose na�ve questions precipitate tragedy in the first. The sections dance around one another like the planets of their settings. Clones, downloaded personalities inhabiting robots, aliens that perhaps mimicked humans so successfully that they forgot who they were, a French culture adopted by its ruthless oppressors--there are lots of ways to lose yourself, and perhaps the worst is to think that freedom consists of owning other people, that identity is won at the expense of others. </p><p>It is easy to be impressed by the intellectual games of Wolfe's stunning book and forget that he is, and always has been, the most intensely moral of SF writers. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p><b>Gene Wolfe</b> has been called "the finest writer the science fiction world has yet produced" by <i>The Washington Post</i>.

Recounting the stirring stories the founders encountered in their favorite histories of Greece and Rome, renowned scholar Carl J. Richard explores what they learned from these vivid tales and how they applied these lessons to their own heroic quest to win American independence and establish a durable republic.</p><p><b>Carl J. Richard</b> is professor of history at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.Carl Richard has given us another engaging and lucid glimpse into the rich and fascinating classical world of America's founding generation. With his thorough knowledge of both the classical past and how men in the eighteenth century understood it, Richard is able to show a broad audience of modern readers&#x2014;who themselves may know little about the classical world&#x2014;why ancient Greece and Rome have so long attracted Americans like a magnet. (Caroline Winterer, Stanford University)<br><br>Carl Richard has written a book that is as entertaining as it is informative. He brings the words and world of the Greek and Roman ancients to life with the same passion and understanding that kindled the Founding Fathers. <i>Greeks and Romans Bearing Gifts</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the moral and intellectual sources that inspired the founders and helped define the ideals of American democracy. (Roger Kimball, editor of <i>The New Criterion<i>)<br><br>I have read Carl Richard's <i>Greeks and Romans Bearing Gifts</i> with great pleasure. This is superb work. Historians of the American founding have long known that the founders were powerfully influenced by the ancient writers, but in the absence of long and tedious labors have not known enough about the subject to make their own studies complete. Richard has performed those labors for us and presented his findings in a way that is both crisply written and richly informative.

Nicholas addresses the failure of reason in modernity to bring about a just society, a society in which people can attain fulfillment. Developing the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, Nicholas argues that we rely too heavily on a conception of rationality that is divorced from tradition and, therefore, incapable of judging ends. Without the ability to judge ends, we cannot engage in debate about the good life or the proper goods that we as individuals and as a society should pursue.<br><br>Nicholas claims that the project of enlightenment&#x2015;defined as the promotion of autonomous reason&#x2015;failed because it was based on a deformed notion of reason as mere rationality, and that a critical theory of society aimed at human emancipation must turn to substantive reason, a reason constituted by and constitutive of tradition. To find a reason capable of judging ends, Nicholas suggests, we must turn to Alasdair MacIntyre&#x2019;s <i>Thomistic-Aristotelianism</i>. Substantive reason comprises thinking and acting on the set of standards and beliefs within a particular tradition. It is the impossibility of enlightenment rationality to evaluate ends and the possibility of substantive reason to evaluate ends that makes the one unsuitable and the other suitable for a critical theory of society. Nicholas&#x2019;s compelling argument, written in accessible language, remains committed to the promise of reason to help individuals achieve a good and just society and a good life. This requires, however, a complete revolution in the way we approach social life.</p><p>Jeffery L. Nicholas is associate professor of philosophy at Mount Angel Seminary.&#x201c;Jeffery L. Nicholas is interested in what he calls a substantive conception of reason that is tradition-based, non-formal, non-instrumental and capable of undoing modernity&#x2019;s differentiation of scientific, moral and aesthetic spheres of rationality. . . . Nicholas&#x2019;s elucidation and defense of his view comprises a critique of subjective reason that relies on Max Horkheimer&#x2019;s work, a criticism of Jurgen Habermas&#x2019;s communicative reason, and an explanation of substantive reason that looks to Alasdair MacIntyre.&#x201d; (Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews)<br><br>"Jeffery Nicholas's book is an important and much needed contribution to the development of a critical theory of society. What may surprise some is that he does this not only by developing the work of the Frankfurt School theorists but also by bringing their analysis into a fruitful dialogue with the vital work of a scholar who is often thought of as their opponent: Alasdair MacIntyre. What results is a fascinating study that finds some common ground between MacIntyre and the Frankfurt School and shows the resources each give us for a renewal of critical thought." (Peter McMylor, University of Manchester)<br><br>"Habermas moved beyond the limitations of earlier Frankfurt School theorists in order to preserve an account of reason as emancipatory. Nicholas uses a conception of reason as tradition-constituted to move beyond Habermas, while still preserving an account of reason as emancipatory. This is a book of the highest interest." (Alasdair MacIntyre, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>&#x201c;Jeffery Nicholas has written an important and valuable book that invites its readers to discover the difficulties of late modern Western thought from the perspective of twentieth-century critical theory, and to consider a response to those difficulties drawn from the work of Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor.&#x201d; (Christopher Stephen Lutz, Saint Meinrad Seminary and School of Theology)<br><br>&#x201c;If you are looking for a &#x2018;safe&#x2019; read, a book that will not force you to question your own presuppositions, this is not the book for you. If, however, you are looking to be challenged and entertained, I suggest you pick up a copy of this dangerous tome and be prepared to change the way you think about reason, philosophy, and the world.&#x201d; (Marx &amp; Philosophy Review of Books)<br><br>&#x201c;Nicholas&#x2019;s approach to these general theses is both interesting and promising.&#x201d; (Journal of Moral Philosophy)<br><br>&#x201c;In this impressive and ambitious book Jeffery Nicholas argues that modernity is &#x2018;infected&#x2019; by a conception of reason that has been stripped of its ability to raise ethical questions and to discuss important moral issues. . . . For Nicholas, the trouble is not simply that we refuse to examine the policies and positions of our own society or of other cultures. It is rather that even when we do engage in evaluation and critique, our critiques inevitably come up short.&#x201d; (International Philosophical Quarterly)</p><h2>This Day Is The Lord&#39;s</h2><p>This is a reissue of Corrie ten Boom&#39;s daily devotional guide, with a brief message, a Bible text and a prayer to make up each meditation.</p><p>Corrie ten Boom was imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for harboring Jews.

So when Farrix&#x2019;s mate, the Lady Jinnarin, appears on Alamar&#x2019;s doorstep, he fears the worst.<br>&nbsp;<br>Months ago, Farrix vanished&#x2014;and Jinnarin has been plagued by nightmares of him being in danger ever since. To find him, Alamar and Jinnarin must embark on a journey across the sea to confront a master of dark magic preparing to open a portal between Mithgar and a destructive Dark God....</p><p><b>Dennis L. McKiernan</b> is the author of many novels, most of them set in the world of Mithgar. He is one of the most prolific and enduring writers of fantasy today. He lives in Arizona with his wife, Martha Lee.Another expansive yarn set in the fantasy world of Mithgar, occurring this time in the First Age, thousands of years before the events in McKiernan's last outing, The Eye of the Hunter (1992). Here, the Mage Alamar is visited by Jinnarin, a diminutive and magical Pysk, a race long vanished from the ken of other beings; Alamar owes the Pysks a great debt. It seems that Farrix, Jinnarin's mate, has gone missing after observing some astonishing auroras. Jinnarin, convinced that Farrix is in terrible danger, has had wrenching dreams of a green sea, a crystal castle, and a black ship. So Alamar must enlist the aid of the legendary Elf, Aravan, who in his magical ship has sailed all the seas of Mithgar for 3,000 years in voyages of derring-do. Aravan agrees to help. Many adventures later, they discover that Farrix is a prisoner of the Black Mage, Durlock, who not only worships the evil god Gyphon but receives orders from him. Durlock steals the astral fire from his sacrificial victims, thus augmenting his enormous power; not even the combined efforts of the good Mages can contain him. Yet, somehow, Mages, Elves, Pysks, Dwarves, and Men must find a way to defeat him, lest Gyphon win his ages-old struggle with the good god Adon. Fairly standard stuff: without originality or particular charm, it just seems to meander on forever. Evidently, the formula to please McKiernan fans. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

(<i>Artforum</i> 2009-10-01)<br><br><i>Commonwealth</i> is a timely contribution to our understanding of contemporary capitalist relations and the potential revolutionary conditions they create...Together Hardt and Negri's work is considered to be responsible for a resurgence of interest in non-orthodox Marxism and its political manifestations. Commonwealth is the final part of a trilogy that began with <i>Empire</i> in 2000, a book that was published during the emergence of the alter-globalization movement. <i>Multitude</i> followed in 2004, developing the ideas that had been introduced in <i>Empire</i>, in particular the concept of the multitude as a new revolutionary subject. <i>Commonwealth</i> is a worthy addition to the trilogy, expamnding and clarifying on the understandings in the previous books, but perhaps more significantly grounding their analysis within an extended discussion of "the common."...<i>Commonwealth</i> is a book that challenges presuppositions about the utility of Marx, and introduces the possibility of combining his insights with the ideas of other significant authors such as Nietzsche, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, who are not traditionally associated with the radical communist project.

Prior to the outbreak of World War I, the personal relationships of Edward, and of his successor and son, George V, flourished with the other royal families of Europe. The closeness of the European families was violently interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914, and the armistice of 1918 brought three empires, namely Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia, crashing down. Some monarchies were strengthened, and others weakened beyond repair. In this well-researched study, John Van der Kiste has drawn upon previously unpublished material for the Royal Archives, Windsor, to show the realtionships between the crowned heads of Europe in the first part of the 20th century. His account sheds new light on foreign policy leading up to World War I.</p><p>John Van der Kiste is a well known author of Royal History, who has also written &#39;The Romanovs&#39; King George V&#39;s Children&#39;.

This is the story of a creative misunderstanding: an erroneous interpretation of the traditions of ancient Egypt became a rich source of inspiration for Europeans from ancient times through the medieval and Renaissance periods to the Baroque era. The misguided notion that hieroglyphs were allegorical, and that they constituted a sacred writing of ideas, exerted a dynamic influence in almost all fields of intellectual and artistic endeavor, as did conceptions of Egypt as the venerable home of true wisdom and of occult and mystic knowledge. The Baroque Piazza Navona in Rome, for instance, is only one of the many great public spaces that center on an Egyptian obelisk and an attempt to read its mysterious signs.</p><br><p>Iversen begins by discussing the nature of Egyptian writing. Then he explains, in detail and with apposite illustrations and quotations, the ways in which Europeans tried to understand and use the hieroglyphs. A final chapter sets Jean Fran�ois Champollion's decipherment of the hieroglyphs into a vividly reconstructed historical context.</p></p><p><b>Erik Iversen</b> is a Danish Egyptologist, who lives in Frederiksberg.

In this masterful new book part graphic memoir, part cultural meditation Igort vividly recounts his personal experiences in Japan, creating comics amid the activities of everyday life, and finding inspiration everywhere: in nature, history, custom, art, and encounters with creators including animation visionary Hayao Miyazaki. With beautifully illustrated reflections on subjects from printmaking to Zen Buddhism, imperial history to the samurai code, Japanese film, literature, and manga, this is a richly rewarding book for anyone interested in Japan or comic arts practiced at the highest level.</p><p>"As a graphic novelist, I obviously can't get enough of books about what it feels like to be a cartoonist, and this is a high point in that pantheon; Igort's memoir is a rich, complicated meditation on art, cultural infatuation and the seen versus the remembered, all told in a collage of words, images, diagrams, photographs, history, ideas, feelings-and most surprisingly-of conflict."<br>--Chris Ware<br><br>"With evident enthusiasm, <i>Japanese Notebooks</i> describes an artist's journey to Japan, from Igort's arrival in 1991 with the preconceptions of an outsider to his discoveries both artistic and personal over many return encounters."<br>--David Mazzucchelli<br><br>7 out of 10 stars "The book is lavishly illustrated throughout, coloured in watercolour for the most part with the art sometimes switching between his normal more Westernised style, a traditional flatter Japanese style and the Manga style embraced in the comics. <br>Overall, it's an insightful book, giving an insider's view of working in an industry where you are, by definition, an outsider. It's a fascinating glimpse into the traditions of Manga, and a thoughtful meditation on Japanese culture."<br>-Starburst Magazine<br><br><b>Starred Review</b> " Mixing detailed sketches and delicate watercolors with occasional historic photographs and pen-and-ink portraits of the people he worked with, the resulting collection is less a complete story and more a conversation with the reader, complete with humorous anecdotes, tangential asides, and the occasional rant about how insane the workload is in Japan compared to what artists are expected to produce in Europe. Throughout the narrative runs a deep respect for the country and its customs. He draws inspiration from its poets and philosophers, its artists and courtesans, its temples and its skyscrapers... <b>A captivating glimpse into the mind of an artist.</b>" <br>-Booklist<br><br><b>2016 Virginia Library Association Graphic Novel Diversity Award "Adult Honor Book"</b><br>"[A]n excellent example of a relationship between the American/western graphic history and Japan's manga/graphic history. The play back forth between the two show the differences and similarities between the two worlds. . . . Aesthetically, the book pushes the medium to the height of its potential."<br><br>"What is most interesting about this book though is that while it is technically a graphic novel filled with wonderful artwork, that's not the primary draw of the book. The biggest draw of this book is actually the stories that are told within the pages. If you have ever expressed interest in living and working in Japan, you owe it to yourself to check out this book and learn a little bit about what it's like from someone who actually took the plunge."<br>-ICv2<br><br>"This is a dense and digressive book. Short, but scholarly musings on Japan's strict class system and the everpresent iconography of the chrysanthemum sit comfortably alongside tributes to pop-culture icons such as Isao Takahata, Hayao Miyazaki, Shigeru Mizuki and Seijun Suzuki - all rendered in a flexible style that is part comics, part illustrated essay."<br>-SciFiNow Magazine (UK)<br><br>"Over more than three decades, the Italian cartoonist who goes by the single name Igort has written and drawn fictional, historical, biographical and experimental books, relatively few of which have been translated into English. JAPANESE NOTEBOOKS: A Journey to the Empire of Signs (Chronicle, $29.95) is partly a remembrance of his experience working in the Japanese comics industry, and mostly an extended meditation on his long, deep fascination with Japan and its art. (As the subtitle suggests, it owes a bit to Roland Barthes's own book about Japan, "Empire of Signs.") It's a loose chain of commentaries on bits of Japanese culture that have made an impression on him - the films of Seijun Suzuki, the life story of the murderer Sada Abe, discrimination against the burakumin caste, the national fascination with chrysanthemums - illustrated with exquisite pen-and-watercolor images that filter iconic Japanese imagery through the visual techniques of European comics.<br>Those observations are peppered by stories of Igort's personal links to Japan, where he's been unusually successful for a Western creator since the early '90s, when he got a job drawing comics for the publishing company Kodansha. (He tells the story of how his initial meeting there went on for three and a half hours: He didn't realize that it was his role to end it, and so his editor raised his rate three times, thinking that Igort was subtly negotiating.) His editors, he notes, told him that they were "honored to work with you, who in turn, in your previous life, were Japanese." That's the deepest longing of any cultural outsider, and like many such outsiders, Igort is particularly attached to the aspects of the country that are gone or vanishing. In the book's afterword, he relates a dream in which his translator imagined him as "a high-class woman of a certain age" in a kimono shop in the early 1900s. Such fantasies rarely involve being, say, a burakumin, but Igort's drawings of that posh, tidy vision are beautiful enough to get away with it." <br>-The New York Times<br><br>"Drawn with precise yet densely lavish style, it balances comic interludes, stranger-in-a-strange-land parables, and side essays on notable writers, filmmakers, and madmen. It's an almost overpoweringly lush book that manages to simultaneously romanticize a foreign culture and lampoon that romanticization."<br> (Nine Graphic Novels You Should Be Reading Right Now), Boston Globe<br><br>"In this pleasantly meandering graphic album, Italian cartoonist Igort (The Ukrainian and Russian Notebooks) collects his scattered impressions of Japan, stitching together short stories, essays, and samples of the comics he drew for manga publisher Kodansha while living in Tokyo. As a foreign-born manga artist, he's put through the rigors of the true manga-ka lifestyle, including the time-honored ritual of being shut in a hotel room by his editors-"under house arrest"-until he meets his deadlines. He talks art with renowned creators Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Jiro Taniguchi and discovers WWII-era manga and anime. Igort is enamored of all things Japanese, writing, "I had convinced myself and my editors at Kodansha that I was Japanese in a past life." If this rose-colored view is a touch na�ve, Igort's warmly colored art, combining the elegant clear line of European comics with the expressive simplicity of manga and a touch of ukiyo-e, goes a long way toward selling his vision."<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly</i><b>Igort</b> is an award-winning and New York Times -bestselling graphic novelist.

At the back&#x2014;too often in the forefront&#x2014;of his mind had always hovered the expectation of dying. But violently: from a breath-sucking assassin&#x2019;s bullet or the burn of a back-alley knife or a shattering explosion. But never of killing himself, not even while confronting his now fossilized existence.<br>&#x201c;It would be understandable,&#x201d; sympathized the small, hunched psychiatrist, George Cowley. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve spent almost thirty years at the front end of British intelligence, always on the edge. Now you&#x2019;re blown, in a Protection Program with a new identity, a retirement salary, a safe house, and a protection regime. All of which you&#x2019;re refusing to acknowledge or observe. From which the only conclusion is that you&#x2019;re either inviting Russian assassination or intending to kill yourself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bollocks,&#x201d; repeated Charlie. He had to do better than this: convince this asshole of an MI5 psychiatrist that he&#x2019;d got it all wrong. As he, in turn, had got it all wrong, staging an intentionally deceiving performance for the too easily detected minders during his limited excursions from the safe house. The internal cameras and listening devices would be recording everything of this performance, too, he accepted.<br>&#x201c;It would have been easier for you, if maybe not for them, if you&#x2019;d had a family: a wife, children, to fill the emptiness within you,&#x201d; Cowley pressed on. &#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t, have you, Charlie? All you&#x2019;ve ever had is the job and now you don&#x2019;t have that anymore.&#x201d;<br>Wrong again! agonized Charlie. He did have a wife. And a daughter. A family still in Russia that no one knew about. Nor could they ever know, because Natalia Fedova was a senior officer in the Federal&#x2019;naya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, the intelligence agency of the Russian Federation that his own MI5 service believed was determined to assassinate him.<br>&#x201c;You expect me to adjust in five minutes to all that&#x2019;s happened!&#x201d; demanded Charlie, discomfited at his inadequate reply.<br>Cowley, who had the highest security clearance, tapped Charlie&#x2019;s file on the table between them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read every word that&#x2019;s in here: know everything you&#x2019;ve done. And having read it I&#x2019;d expect you to understand the very real danger you&#x2019;re in and accept all the protection that&#x2019;s being offered.&#x201d;<br>What danger was Natalia facing after his most recent Moscow assignment? Charlie asked himself, as he had repeatedly over the past three months. If he was blown, as MI5 believed him to be, the search might stretch back to his phoney Moscow defection, when Natalia Fedova had been his interrogator. Charlie had never been totally satisfied then she&#x2019;d sanitized their subsequent relationship from what then would have been KGB records. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not convinced the risk is as great as everyone believes it to be.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for the Director-General to decide, not you. And that decision&#x2019;s been made.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As yours has been made,&#x201d; Charlie fought back. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You ever kill anyone, Charlie?&#x201d; demanded the psychiatrist, unexpectedly.<br>&#x201c;Never intentionally.&#x201d; That was debatable, thought Charlie, uneasy at the prescience of the other man. Charlie hoped there was nothing in the bulky personnel dossier with which Cowley could catch him out.<br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t it ever worry you, people getting killed? Assassinated?&#x201d; persisted the other man.<br>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t happen often and when it did&#x2014;or had to&#x2014;it was part of the job: I never pulled a trigger.&#x201d; That reply was a cop-out, Charlie acknowledged, but they&#x2019;d been talking of death and dying for the past thirty minutes and he was fed up at the verbal ping-pong.<br>&#x201c;Could you have pulled a trigger, if you&#x2019;d had to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d been trained to that level, as a last resort: I never got to that resort.&#x201d; Charlie was surprised at the sudden although easily suppressed anger, an emotion he hadn&#x2019;t experienced for a long time because it indicated lack of control, which was always dangerous professionally.<br>&#x201c;Do you still think you could pull the trigger, if you had to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not with the barrel against my own head, no,&#x201d; refused Charlie, guessing the direction in which Cowley was leading.<br>&#x201c;You sure about that?&#x201d; demanded the psychiatrist. &#x201c;Or are you pissed off that the rest of your life is going to be spent incarcerated in security-covered, audio-and-CCTV-equipped safe houses, forever buried deep within a protection program, never ever able again to meet or speak to anyone you once knew?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get there,&#x201d; responded Charlie, dismissively.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not even trying,&#x201d; accused Cowley, dismissive in return. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to have adopted the new name&#x2014;the entirely new identity&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve been allocated and you haven&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re supposed never to establish patterns&#x2014;never the same restaurants, never the same pub, never the same cinema, never the same route or transport to the same supermarket&#x2014;and you haven&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re supposed to alter the way you dress, alter as much of your appearance as possible, and you haven&#x2019;t: you&#x2019;re even still wearing those spread-apart Hush Puppies about to fall off your awkward feet.

Why was the Arts and Crafts movement so popular with the American middle class at the end of the 19th century? Why did Modernism replace traditional architectural styles after World War II? Mark Gelernter provides fresh answers to questions like these, convincingly showing how buildings express powerful cultural forces.<br><br>Embodying deeply felt attitudes about fundamental issues, buildings express our relationship with nature, our social relations with others, the importance of the individual, the value of science and technology, and our political role in the world. He explains how designers sometimes expressed these ideas with available building technologies, while at other times they invented new technologies in order to realize new ideas. Each of the ten chronological chapters, accompanied by almost 300 photographs, drawings, and maps, begins with a broad survey of the dominant cultural forces and technologies, and then discusses how designers of the day responded with particular architectural forms.</p><p>7 1/2 x 9 1/4 trim. 191 illus. 84 drawings. 23 plans. 10 maps.

By providing a global framework for American architecture, it guides the reader to evaluate the influence of major cultural events on architecture and provides the basis for understanding the ongoing search for an American architectural style. The author ties the broad picture of the development of American architecture to specific places and times by opening each chapter with a map of North America that illustrates major geopolitical, economic, and cultural events . . . The strengths of this book, and its contributions to the study of American architecture, lie in its broad description of the history of American architecture, including a thorough explanation of the architecture of the first civilizations of North America; its parallel exploration of the development of the architecture of Native Americans, Europeans, and Americans; its excellent mixture of photographs and line drawings of buildings throughout history; and its extensive glossary and bibliography.

Some flee from jobs they love, forced out by mean-spirited co-workers, subordinates or superiors -- often with the tacit approval of higher management. <p>The authors, Dr. Noa Davenport, Ruth Distler Schwartz, and Gail Pursell Elliott have written a book for every employee and manager in America. The book deals with what has become a household word in Europe: Mobbing. </p><p>Mobbing is a "ganging up" by several individuals, to force someone out of the workplace through rumor, innuendo, intimidation, discrediting, and particularly, humiliation. Mobbing is a serious form of nonsexual, nonracial harassment. It has been legally described as status-blind harassment. </p><p>Mobbing affects the mental and physical health of victims. It extracts staggering costs from victims, their families, and from organizations. </p><p> With this new book, <i>Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace</i>, there is a name for the problem and help for the victims. The book helps readers to understand what mobbing is, why it occurs, how it affects a victim and organizations, and what people can so. The authors have interviewed victims from across the U.S. and the book contains many quotes that poignantly illustrate the gravity of the mobbing experience. An overview of the literature and research is provided as well as many practical strategies to help the victims, managers, healthcare and legal professionals.

Full-color photos.</p><p>Producer, magician, writer, puppeteer, minister, husband, father, Fred Rogers started out in children's television thirty years ago. The direction he trailblazed was the "creation of television programming that spoke, with respect, to the concerns of early childhood, not as adults see it but as children feel it."<p> He has received virtually every major award in the television industry for work in his field, and dozens of others from special-interest groups.</p><p> Fred Rogers lives in Pennsylvania.</p><p> </p>PreSchool-Grade 1 Excellent color photographs of multiracial children illustrate these concept books, which update material originally presented in Mister Rogers Talks About (Platt &amp; Munk, 1974; o.p.). Although there are numerous books about starting school, Going to Day Care is one of the few titles which deals with day care. The text discusses both family day care and day-care centers and deals with activities that concern children, such as eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom. The second title serves as a starting point for parent and child discussions about The New Baby. Although the text deals with feelings of jealousy and envy, they are not the major focus, as they are in Martha Alexander's Nobody Asked Me If I Wanted a Baby Sister (Dial, 1971). The positive and negative aspects of a new baby in the house are presented in a manner easily understood by preschoolers, and are further clarified by the liberal use of color photographs. Questions are included as discussion starters, in a manner similar to the way Mister Rogers speaks on his television program. Two very fine titles about children's first experiences.

Matthew Schwartz and Kalman Kaplan set out to prove that the converse is true in the text of the Hebrew Bible. Examining the stories of women in Scripture -- Rebecca, Miriam, Gomer, Ruth and Naomi, Lot's wife, Zipporah, and dozens more -- Schwartz and Kaplan illustrate the biblical woman's strong feminine sense of being crucial to God's plan for the world and for history, courageously seeking the greatest good for herself and others whatever the circumstances. Empowering, illuminating, and fascinating,&nbsp;<i>The Fruit of Her Hands</i>&nbsp;makes a singular contribution to the fields of biblical and women's studies.</p><p>Matthew B Schwartz teaches ancient history and literature in the Departments of History and Near East at Wayne State University. Kalman J Kaplan is Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.<b>Rabbi Daniel Lapin</b><br> &#x2014; founder and president of Toward Tradition<br> "With commendable courage, Kalman Kaplan and Matthew Schwartz defy convention to proclaim the timeless truth of God's plan for men and women."<br><br><b>Rabbi Byron L. Sherwin</b><br> &#x2014; Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies<br> "This informative, provocative, insightful, and eminently readable book both depicts and celebrates the women of Hebrew Scripture. Their independence, interdependence, courage, integrity, wisdom, and commitment are presented as an expression of covenantal biblical values, as a source of emulation for us today as we seek models for personal identity and interpersonal relationships, and as a much-needed alternative to the undesirable models rooted in Greek mythology and to the demeaning portrayal of women in Western philosophy epitomized by Aristotle's definition of a woman as a castrated man. As this fine work demonstrates, the wisdom of the Bible continues to address the challenges of yesterday and today with moral relevance, powerful poignancy, and remarkable psychological insight."</p><h2>How Proust Can Change Your Life</h2><p>3rd printing, shelf wear to dust jacket, page edges tanned. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>This is a genius-level piece of writing that manages to blend literary biography with self-help and tongue-in-cheek with the profound. The quirky, early 1900s French author Marcel Proust acts as the vessel for surprisingly impressive nuggets of wisdom on down-to-earth topics such as why you should never sleep with someone on the first date, how to protect yourself against lower back pain, and how to cope with obnoxious neighbors. Here&#39;s proof that our ancestors had just as much insight as the gurus du jour and perhaps a lot more wit. De Botton simultaneously pokes fun at the self-help movement and makes a significant contribution to its archives.Alain de Botton combines two unlikely genres--literary biography and self-help manual--in the hilarious and unexpectedly practical How Proust Can Change Your Life.<br><br>Who would have thought that Marcel Proust, one of the most important writers of our century, could provide us with such a rich source of insight into how best to live life? Proust understood that the essence and value of life was the sum of its everyday parts. As relevant today as they were at the turn of the century, Proust's life and work are transformed here into a no-nonsense guide to, among other things, enjoying your vacation, reviving a relationship, achieving original and unclich�d articulation, being a good host, recognizing love, and understanding why you should never sleep with someone on a first date. It took de Botton to find the inspirational in Proust's essays, letters and fiction and, perhaps even more surprising, to draw out a vivid and clarifying portrait of the master from between the lines of his work.<br><br>Here is Proust as we have never seen or read him before: witty, intelligent, pragmatic. He might well change your life.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Bolsheviks Come to Power: The Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd</h2><p>Documents the collapse of the Kerensky government, the abortive July uprising, General Kornilov&#39;s unsuccessful coup attempt, and the strategies and tactics of Lenin that led to the Bolsheviks&#39; establishment of a Communist government</p><p>Alex Rabinowitch, a world renowned authority on the history of the Russian Revolution, is Professor emiritus in history at Indiana University, where he began teaching in 1968.

S. Lewis, and a spiritual strength that sustained Vanauken after his wife&#39;s untimely death.</p><p><i>A Severe Mercy</i>, by Sheldon Vanauken, is a heart-rending love story described by its author as "the spiritual autobiography of a love rather than of the lovers." Vanauken chronicles the birth of a powerful pagan love borne out of the relationship he shares with his wife, Davy, and describes the growth of their relationship and the dreams that they share. As a symbol of their love, they name their dream schooner the <i>Grey Goose</i>, "for the grey goose, if its mate is killed flies on alone and never takes another." <p> While studying at Oxford, Sheldon and Davy develop a friendship with C.S. Lewis, under whose influence and with much intellectual scrutiny they accept the Christian doctrine. As their devotion to God intensifies, Sheldon realizes that he is no longer Davy's primary love--God is. Within this discovery begins a brewing jealousy.</p><p> Shortly after, Davy acquires a fatal illness. After her death Sheldon embarks on an intense experience of grief, "to find the meaning of it, taste the whole of it ... to learn from sorrow whatever it had to teach." Through painstaking reveries, he comes to discover the meaning of "a mercy as severe as death, a severity as merciful as love." He learns that her death "had these results: It brought me as nothing else could do to know and end my jealously of God. It saved her faith from assault. ...And it saved our love from perishing."</p><p> Replete with 18 letters from C.S. Lewis, <i>A Severe Mercy</i> addresses some of the universal questions that surround faith--the existence of God and the reasons behind tragedy. <i>--Jacque Holthusen</i></p>The late Sheldon Vanauken was educated at the Universities of Yale and Oxford. For many years he was a Professor of English and History at Lynchburg College in his native Virginia.</p><h2>The Core Values Handbook</h2><p>The Core Values Index (CVI) characterizes and measures each person&#39;s Real Core Values Nature.

This assessment and the Taylor Protocols were developed in the fires of 400 business turn-around and business restructuring projects. A first look at the revolutionary Employment Pre-Selection Science that David Mashburn, Ph.D., asserts ...is the first system to characterize and quantify the innate unchanging nature of individuals, and the first employment system to connect this unchanging nature with the tasks of the job.</p><p>Lynn Ellsworth Taylor is President of Taylor Protocols, Inc., a professional business and human capital management firm from Seattle, Washington. He developed the Core Values Index out of his need to hire the right people for the right jobs. He wanted to better understand, manage, train, coach and motivate the people he was serving. In the early 80s&#39; Taylor worked with Dr. Ed Geiger to develop the first non-invasive cardiac output computer. This work required Taylor to help create algorithms for pattern-recognition and pattern-matching. In 1983, Taylor applied his algorithm knowledge to speech technology creating the first IBM PC- compatible speech recognition system. Frustrated with tests that claimed to improve hiring and give insight someone s personality, Taylor set off on a 15-year mission to perfect an instrument that could accurately measure the innate unchanging capacity of individuals to make certain kinds of contributions. He created a highly reliable 10-minute assessment that reveals a persons innate, unchanging Core Values Nature. In 1998, he began using the CVI as his diagnostic algorithms to develop Top Performer Profiles, the central technology of his new Employment Pre-Selection Sciences. The accuracy of the tool and the effectiveness of the sciences have allowed hundreds of companies to achieve extraordinary growth in the top and bottom line simultaneously helping individuals find their place of highest and best contribution.I believe there is no personality or leadership profiling system that will out perform Taylor s Core Values Index. No other evaluation tool takes the participant beyond business, social and psychological understanding into the realm of the innate unchanging nature in each of us. No technology or system delivers higher productivity and greater business profits than his revolutionary Employment Pre-Selection Science. Taylors Core Values Nature and the related Catalytic Values are a transcendent new insight into the Human Operating System. It has truly changed the way I think about myself, the way I select and manager employees and the way I communicate with others. --Glen Villalobos, National Executive, Human Resources Volunteers of America<br><br>I bought this book and used this test on myself and everyone in my company. We have rejuvenated our team and established a stronger business culture. The real surprise came when I gave the Core Values Index to my partner. We have re-established a stronger working relationship based upon better understanding and better communications. My thanks to Mr. Taylor. --Lori Kind, President, Business Exchange Center<br><br>This Core Values Index assessment and the resulting Employment Pre-Selection Science, created by Taylor Protocols, informs better than the more expensive tests and allows me evaluate employees and candidates for employment within minutes rather than weeks. Because the system is so reliable, we are able to pre-select future top performers, keeping us from making costly hiring errors. The Core Values Handbook has helped me better understand what to expect from my employees and from myself. When it comes to finding and managing people, we all need all the help we can get. --Torrey Russell, Sales Manager, WinSales, Inc.</p><h2>McBain Trio: Lullaby, Vespers, Widows Three Classic Novels of the 87th Precinct</h2><p>McBain Trio is the 2nd volume of Mystery Guild&#39;s Lost Classics Omnibus Series.

With swirling darkness on a cold stone hearth. Or, in a bar, with a beautiful woman, who had a problem. It all depends on how you look at it.</p><p>I had come back to Tien after months away. Not for me, but for Faran, my apprentice. She needed help I couldn&#x2019;t give her&#x2014;delicate and difficult magical healing&#x2014;so I had brought her to a friend. Treatment was slow and painful for Faran, but it seemed to be working. Her sight had fully returned and the headaches were much better. So I&#x2019;d decided I could leave her alone for an evening and visit old haunts.</p><p>Mistake? It all depends on how you feel about powerful magical sendings and other people&#x2019;s problems.</p><p>The Gryphon&#x2019;s Head was a dive bar of the worst sort, full of criminals and other shady types. It was also coming home. I had spent six years living in a tiny room over the stables there. I&#x2019;d made my money as a shadow jack in those days&#x2014;the underworld&#x2019;s all-purpose freelancer. It was a very long fall from the days when they&#x2019;d first called me Aral Kingslayer and the mighty had feared the coming of my shadow. Well, and lately, they had begun to call me that again, but that&#x2019;s another story entirely.</p><p>You see, I&#x2019;m an assassin, or was once&#x2014;one of the best in the world&#x2014;and my shadow lives. His name is Triss. He is my familiar, a thing of elemental darkness and magic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which brings me back to the smoke.</p><p>Triss saw it first, and whispered into my mind, <i>Aral, ware the hearth!</i></p><p>I turned in my chair, and saw the first twisting coils of smoke begin to rise from the bare stones. I wasn&#x2019;t the only one. A pair of Cobble-Runners&#x2014;one of the local gangs&#x2014;who were sitting closer, noticed it about then, too. They leaped out of their chairs and backed away from the hearth, shooting the occasional glance my way as the smoke built slowly.</p><p>They were only the first. Within a few moments the whole bar was shifting attention between whatever was building on the hearth and me. The bar&#x2019;s owner, Jerik, came over as the ball reached the size of a kneeling human.</p><p>&#x201c;Aral?&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;What have you brought into my bar this time?&#x201d;</p><p>I wanted to tell him I hadn&#x2019;t brought anything, but honesty forbade me. I didn&#x2019;t know what the thing on the hearth was, or where it had come from, but the chances were good that it was there for me. My life has taught me to doubt coincidence, and the odds that a piece of magic like nothing I&#x2019;d ever seen before would appear in the Gryphon&#x2019;s hearth by chance on the same day that I finally returned after so long away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, let&#x2019;s just say that I wouldn&#x2019;t take that bet, and leave it there.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I trailed off as the thing stood up.</p><p>I say &#x201c;thing&#x201d; where I should call it a woman, because that&#x2019;s what it had become. A woman of smoke. Tall and slender and very familiar. She wore the loose pants and shirt of the order I had once belonged to, and the swirling loops of smoke perfectly mirrored the dyed patterns of my own grays.</p><p>The hood of her cowl was drawn up to hide her face, and the smoke blurred what features I could see within, but the shape of her body and the way that she moved were instantly recognizable, even in smoky avatar&#x2014;which form made her slow and deliberate as though she were underwater or might come apart at any moment.</p><p>Siri, the Mythkiller, First Blade of Namara. I recognized her at a level below thinking and beyond question. This was Siri, my sister in the service of Justice, my better in the arts of magic and the assassin, and perhaps the only person in the world who could ask for my life and expect me to give it into her care without thought or question. Both duty and honor demanded no less. I met her halfway to the hearth.</p><p>&#x201c;Siri?&#x201d;</p><p>The smoke swirled under her cowl, and a twist of white might have been a smile, but the figure spoke no words. After a long moment, she nodded. It was a slow movement&#x2014;as they all had been&#x2014;and it feathered the edges of her cowl.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you need?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Triss whispered into my mind. <i>Careful, Aral. You can&#x2019;t be sure it&#x2019;s really her.</i></p><p>But I was. <i>No. This is her. I&#x2019;m certain of it.</i></p><p>The figure extended its left hand, palm up. With the other it gestured me to touch the extended hand with my own. When flesh met smoke I felt a faint electrical tingle, like distant magelightning, but no other sensation of contact.</p><p>Her right hand came forward and began a slow but intricate dance of gesture over our joined palms. I almost jerked away then, as I recognized the motions a priest would make at a handfasting, but forced myself to stillness. No matter how strange the manifestation, this was something of Siri. I could feel it in my soul, and I owed her whatever she asked of me.</p><p>When she was done, that white swirl of a smile flashed within her cowl once more. Then she fell apart, splitting into a hundred wisps on the breeze.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that all about?&#x201d; asked Jerik.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;But I think I&#x2019;d better find out.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Aral,</i> Triss spoke into my mind, <i>she left you a ring.</i></p><p>Looking down, I saw that he was right. There, wrapped around my wedding finger, was a ring of smoke. It was only as I examined the ring that I realized none of what I had just seen bore any light of magic, and the only enchantments that I knew of that acted that way were god-magic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p><b>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s </b>marvelous. I&#x2019;ve never encountered anything like it.&#x201d; Harad moved careful fingers this way and that as though he were trying to twist my new ring. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> like god-magic, but it certainly wasn&#x2019;t made by any normal mortal sort of spell. I have no idea what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>I gave the ancient librarian a hard look. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to sound so happy about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m six hundred years old, Aral, and a master sorcerer for five hundred and fifty of those years. I have been the chancellor of one of the great Magelands universities and studied more varieties of magic than most spellwrights are even aware of. Finding something wholly new is a treasure beyond price.&#x201d; He paused and rubbed his chin. &#x201c;Though, I will be very sorry if it devours your soul before I have time to get it sorted out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>My shadow twisted itself into the silhouette of a small and rather worried-looking dragon. Triss rose up off the floor so that he could sniff at the smoke ring. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; the Shade told me. &#x201c;If it tries anything like that I&#x2019;ll bite your finger off before it gets the chance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thanks, Triss.&#x201d; I turned back Harad. &#x201c;Is that really likely?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a small joke on my part, nothing more.&#x201d; Harad frowned. &#x201c;Though it seems to have gone wide of the mark. You didn&#x2019;t look nearly as alarmed by that prospect as I had hoped you might, but then, it&#x2019;s hard to read you. You do grim and blank as well as any man I know.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not something I&#x2019;m going to dance about, but my soul&#x2019;s pretty badly mortgaged already. Between my failures since the death of my goddess and the need for efik chewing a hole in the back of my mind, there&#x2019;s not much left for anything else to carve off a piece.&#x201d;</p><p>Triss winced&#x2014;because he worried&#x2014;but he didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>&#x201c;The cravings haven&#x2019;t eased in the months since the Kitsune first forced you to eat those few beans, then?&#x201d; It was the question of a healer who considered me one of his patients. &#x201c;I had hoped it would pass, but with the death of Namara you seem to have lost your immunity to the darker side of the drug.&#x201d;</p><p>That immunity wasn&#x2019;t all I&#x2019;d lost when the goddess of Justice was murdered. The list was long and brutal. Most of my magical protections. My home. My family. My friends. My reason for living. No, my efik problem didn&#x2019;t even make the top five, however much harder it might make my life.</p><p>Again, I shrugged. &#x201c;I have good days and bad, just like with the booze, though efik hunger is sharper, and the hooks in my soul are deeper. But what can you expect? I tried it first shortly after I entered the temple, though I didn&#x2019;t really acquire the habit till my teens. But I never touched so much as a drop of alcohol until after my goddess was murdered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Horrible stuff, whiskey.&#x201d; A girl&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;drifting down from the shadows atop a nearby set of bookshelves.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Faran,&#x201d; I said to my apprentice. &#x201c;I was wondering when you were going to let us know you were there.&#x201d;</p><p>She released the shadow that enshrouded her as she dropped silently to the floor. She landed a few yards beyond Harad, and I revised my earlier &#x201c;girl&#x201d; to &#x201c;young woman&#x201d; when I met her gaze. At eighteen or thereabouts, I had to admit that she&#x2019;d grown up a lot in the last year. The cloud of living darkness that had concealed her from view on the shelves now flowed down to the floor, becoming the shadow of a phoenix.</p><p>My eyes immediately went to the scar that ran down from her forehead across her left eyelid and onto her cheek. It looked better than it had before her sessions with Harad, but I still winced whenever I saw it. She&#x2019;d picked it up guarding my back, which made it my fault.</p><p>&#x201c;You knew I was there?&#x201d; She flicked her dark hair angrily back over her shoulder. &#x201c;How? My form was perfect, and I know you didn&#x2019;t cross my shadow trail. What gave me away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your nature,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I know you, and I know you wouldn&#x2019;t have missed me coming in to consult with Harad. You didn&#x2019;t greet us when we entered. That means you decided to make a game of stalking us.&#x201d; I gestured around the large open reading area at the end of the narrow stacks. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one place in this entire room where you could both listen <i>and</i> be sure Triss wouldn&#x2019;t sniff out Ssithra. That&#x2019;s atop the shelves. Therefore&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair point.&#x201d; Faran smiled and bowed to acknowledge the hit. &#x201c;Now, let me see what the fuss is about.&#x201d; She reached out to touch the smoke ring on my wedding finger, then abruptly snatched her hand back. &#x201c;Hey, it bit me!&#x201d;</p><p>Ssithra flapped shadow wings and lifted off the floor, putting herself between Faran and my ring.</p><p>&#x201c;It bit you?&#x201d; Harad asked brightly. &#x201c;Let me see.&#x201d;</p><p>Now it was Faran&#x2019;s turn to give the librarian a hard look as he pulled her hand toward him. &#x201c;The thing<i> bites</i> me, and you act like someone gave you a damned Winter-Round present?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hush, child. I&#x2019;m working. Hmm, no blood&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Harad reached through a hole in the air with his free hand and pulled an emerald quizzing glass from the pocket dimension where he kept most of his more delicate tools. He held the lens above Faran&#x2019;s injured finger. &#x201c;<i>Very</i> interesting.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked over his shoulder. The crystalline lens showed four tiny black marks on Faran&#x2019;s fingertip&#x2014;marks invisible both to magesight and my mortal eyes. But only for a few heartbeats. Then the spots wisped up like smoke and blew away.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; asked Triss.</p><p>&#x201c;It really did bite her.&#x201d; Harad dropped the emerald back through the hole in the air and it vanished. &#x201c;Though, what it drew wasn&#x2019;t blood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I told you so,&#x201d; said Faran.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would it do that?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;And, how?&#x201d;</p><p>A huge grin spread across Harad&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;I have <i>no</i> idea.&#x201d; Then he paused and looked thoughtful. &#x201c;I take that back. I have no idea about the how, but I think I can make an educated guess about the why.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d; Faran demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Smoke or no, it&#x2019;s a wedding ring. That&#x2019;s a very specific and ancient sort of magic. My assumption would be that it saw you as a potential rival for Aral&#x2019;s affections.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wait, it what?&#x201d; Faran blinked several times, blushed, then shook her head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s idiotic!&#x201d;</p><p>Harad grinned. &#x201c;It quite likely is, but I don&#x2019;t think the ring thinks so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stupid ring,&#x201d; grumbled Faran. Then her expression shifted suddenly from annoyance to something like shock. &#x201c;Hold it. If it&#x2019;s a wedding ring, does that mean that Aral and Siri are married now, for real and legally?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about legally,&#x201d; said Harad. &#x201c;But magically and symbolically, yes. That&#x2019;s a sort of marriage that&#x2019;s deeper and more profound than mere laws, and <i>far</i> less disseverable.&#x201d;</p><p>Faran rounded on <i>me</i> now. &#x201c;Aral, did you know that was going to happen when the smoke figure offered you that ring?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;Siri didn&#x2019;t offer me the ring precisely, but she did make it pretty clear she wanted my participation in something like a formal handfasting, and marriage is where these things typically lead, ring and all. Given that we had consummated our relationship in the traditional way long ago, I probably should have realized the implications.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re all right with that?&#x201d; she demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. If Siri asked me for my life, I would give it to her. Why would I refuse to marry her if that&#x2019;s what she needs of me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t seen or heard from Siri in eight years!&#x201d; Faran&#x2019;s voice started angry and got angrier. &#x201c;Then a smoke figure that may or may not even be her shows up, asks you to get hitched, and you just say &#x2018;yes&#x2019; like it&#x2019;s nothing? You don&#x2019;t even know what sort of person she is now, Aral. That&#x2019;s insane!&#x201d; She glanced at Harad as though seeking his support, but the old librarian had an even better blank expression than I do.</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps it is,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Perhaps Siri <i>has</i> become a monster in the years since I last saw her. I can&#x2019;t imagine it, but I couldn&#x2019;t imagine Master Kelos betraying the order and our goddess either. None of that changes what Siri once was and the duty I owe her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How can it not?&#x201d; demanded Faran.</p><p>&#x201c;Because what I owe Siri isn&#x2019;t about her. It&#x2019;s about me, and my duty here is perfectly clear.&#x201d; I paused for a long moment, trying to think of how best to explain the thing properly. Faran was my apprentice and if that was going to mean anything I had to let her see my thinking. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have much of my old soul left, but what there is, is bound to the service of Namara, whether that takes the shape of the goddess herself, her ideal of justice, or simply the word of her First Blade. I <i>can&#x2019;t</i> turn Siri down if I want to remain true to what little remains of Aral the Blade.&#x201d;</p><p>Faran glared at my shadow now. &#x201c;Triss, don&#x2019;t you have anything to say about this?&#x201d;</p><p>The little dragon flipped his wings back and forth noncommittally. &#x201c;I am concerned about the manner of the thing. But what we have heard from those who <i>did</i> betray the goddess suggests that even Kelos believed Siri was incorruptible. It&#x2019;s one of the chief reasons why he sent both Aral and Siri away when the temple was about to fall.&#x201d;</p><p>Ah Kelos, my mentor and master&#x2014;two-hundred-year-old lord of assassins, and the father I never had. The Deathwalker. He was perhaps the greatest Blade who ever lived, and, without any doubt, the greatest traitor to our order. His actions had materially contributed to the death of our goddess.

Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus&#39;s philosophy of the absurd and existentialism, though Camus personally rejected the latter label. The title character is Meursault, an indifferent French Algerian (&#34;a citizen of France domiciled in North Africa, a man of the Mediterranean, an homme du midi yet one who hardly partakes of the traditional Mediterranean culture&#34;). He attends his mother&#39;s funeral. A few days later he kills an Arab man in French Algiers, who was involved in a conflict with a friend. Meursault is tried and sentenced to death. The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault&#39;s first-person narrative view before and after the murder, respectively.</p><p>French novelist, essayist, and playwright. Albert Camus (1913-1960) was a representative of non-metropolitan French literature. His origin in Algeria and his experiences there in the thirties were dominating influences in his thought and work. Among his works, The Plague (1947), The Just (1949) The Fall (1956). He was killed in a road accident in 1960.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>Soccer in Sun and Shadow</h2><p>The passion and the glory of the beautiful game, captured on the eve of the World Cup. From the origins of soccer to the World Cup played in the US in 1994, one of Latin America&#x2019;s most fluent and widely read commentators captures the enduring appeal of the world&#x2019;s greatest game. Eduardo Galeano seeks out the mystical and the bewitched, the romance and the emotional destitution experienced by players and fans the world round. Here is a story of love and death: of the suicide of Abdon Porte, who shot himself in the center circle of the National Stadium; of the Argentine manager who wouldn&#x2019;t let his team eat chicken because it would bring bad luck; of the Russian goalkeeper who prepared his min and soothed his nerves with a cigarette and a dash of vodka before each game. Published in the run-up to the 1998 World Cup, this is the glory of soccer in all its international hues, with its multilingual cries of despair, victory and passion. No one who has ever played in or cheered on a soccer side will want to miss this book.</p><p><b>Eduardo Galeano</b> is also the author of <i>Open Veins of Latin America, Days and Nights of Love and War, The Book of Embraces, We Say No</i>, and other works.

But accounts drawn up in this way give an entirely false picture of a company&#39;s health, and in fact, many of the firms which employed these methods subsequently went bust.

With titles such as &#x201c;Stride Piano,&#x201d; &#x201c;Gutbucket,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Can-Can,&#x201d; these poems have the sharp completeness of vocalized songs and follow a classic blues trajectory: praising and professing undying devotion (&#x201c;To watch you walk / cross the room in your black / corduroys is to see / civilization start&#x201d;), only to end up lamenting the loss of love (&#x201c;No use driving / like rain, past / where you at&#x201d;). As Young conquers the sorrow left on his doorstep, the poems broaden to embrace not just the wisdom that comes with heartbreak but the bittersweet wonder of triumphing over adversity at all.<br> <br>Sexy and tart, playfully blending an African American idiom with traditional lyric diction, Young&#x2019;s voice is pure American: joyous in its individualism and singing of the self at its strongest.</p><p>&#x201c;It is one thing to acknowledge that the blues are a kind of poetry, but another to produce a book of authentic poetry that constitutes a new kind of blues. Tender, sassy, and just plain cool, the poems in Kevin Young&#x2019;s <i>Jelly Roll </i>uniquely twine together the roots of both music and language. You can almost hear the three chords in the background.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Billy Collins<br><br>&#x201c;In Young&#x2019;s alchemy, succulent scraps are gathered from daily life, distilled, and emerge, finally, as portable nuggets of home, carried wherever the poet may travel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Voice Literary Supplement<br><br></i> &#x201c;This poet&#x2019;s gift of storytelling and understanding of the music inherent in the oral tradition of language re-creates for us an inner history which is compelling and authentic and American.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Lucille Clifton<br><br>&#x201c;As a poet, Young is as dazzlingly agile and as hard-hitting as Jack Johnson in his prime.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Lorenzo ThomasKevin Young&#x2019;s first book, <i>Most Way Home</i>, was selected for the National Poetry Series and won the Zacharis First Book Award from Ploughshares.

It contains His actual words.<br>The Bible is God's book. He gave it by inspiration. The words of scripture are God's words. But not only did God give His words to man, He also promised to preserve them... for specific reasons. They are shown to us in the Bible. We believe that we have the perfectly preserved words of God in our 1611 King James Bible, also called the Authorized Version or KJV.<br>Today, hundreds of books call themselves Bibles. In this book you will see why they cannot all be the words of God and why only the 1611 KJV is God's perfectly preserved words in English. This book is a "fill-in-the-blank" workbook that requires that the student have a King James Bible. Through its five lessons you will learn that the Bible is God-breathed "scripture." You will see that the Bible clearly claims to be more than just "God's ideas" . . . it is God's actual Words, preserved through the ages for instruction in righteousness. Finally, you see how some modern Bibles actually change God's teachings.<br>This book is useful in a Sunday School class, particularly with young people. It will build faith in the Scriptures and the God who gave them.</p><p><br>Gary Miller is pastor of Grace Harbor Church in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.We must become men and women who can say with boldness, Thus saith the Lord!

Aboard were seven white men, a crew of forty islanders, and one woman: a short-haired, barefoot, cigarette-smoking American, Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson, wife of the famous novelist Robert Louis Stevenson.

Her diary and its accompanying photographs offer unique glimpses of life in some of the last independent Pacific kingdoms and those just coming under colonial rule at the end of the nineteenth century.

It focuses on the Central Mexican Aztecs--called the Mexica--who believed in multiple souls that animated the body, gave humans their shared and individual characteristics, and survived the body after death. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including visual representations on Precolumbian monuments, colonial Spanish chronicles, early medical and travel accounts, and modern ethnography, Jill McKeever Furst argues that the Mexica turned not to mental or linguistic constructions for verifying ideas about the soul but to what they experienced through the senses. According to McKeever Furst, Mexica definitions and characterizations of the souls were influenced by their observations of human physiology--including birth, temperature changes in the body, normal aging, and the processes of death and dying-- and by their experiences with their environment, specifically the lands near lakes that provided them with unusual visual and olfactory sensations (one of the souls is based on the odor of marshes). Providing as supporting evidence native beliefs about the soul in the ideologies of other Uto-Aztecan speakers ranging from the United States to Central America, McKeever Furst challenges deconstructionist theories that cultural phenomena are purely mental constructs.</p><p>Jill Leslie McKeever Furst is professor of art history at Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia and consulting scholar in the American section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.</p><h2>World of Our Fathers (Touchstone Book)</h2><p>It was a great adventure--the emigration in the 1880s of two million Jews from East Europe to the United States.

But can one man defeat an Empire - and what will be the consequences if he does? The time-travelling adventures of Bastable, an incarnation of the Eternal Champion, are widely considered to be among the first steampunk novels, and display Moorcock&#39;s remarkable ingenuity and skill at plotting to great effect. Contains THE WARLORD OF THE AIR, THE LAND LEVIATHAN and THE STEEL TSAR.</p><p>Michael Moorcock (1939-) Michael Moorcock is one of the most important figures in British SF and Fantasy literature. The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric.

Adding a depth of understanding that can&#x2019;t be obtained by looking only at the commandment itself, he shows how each commandment echoes elsewhere in the Old Testament, how it was violated in Israel&#x2019;s history, and how it surfaces again in the New Testament.

She has been an editor at <i>Elle</i>, <i>Town &amp; Country</i>, and <i>Mirabella</i> magazines.The 1905 battle for control of the Equitable Life Assurance Society strikingly parallels the corporate scandals that dominate headlines a century later. For example, majority shareholder James Hazen Hyde, accompanied by a team of corporate lawyers, told an investigating committee he'd authorized questionable deals on the advice of executives whom he had trusted, while James W. Alexander, who sought to kick Hyde off the board, complained he was being punished for blowing the whistle on the company's shaky finances. But, as Beard, who's written for Elle and Mirabella, ably shows, Hyde didn't resemble any modern-day CEO-more like several of them rolled into one. Inheriting his position while still a bachelor in his 20s, he was a fixture on New York's society pages, arguably more famous for his wardrobe and love of high-speed carriage racing than for his job. The titular ball was an all-night costume party, complete with a private theatrical performance, with a price tag of at least $50,000. That's even more expensive than it sounds; the failure to compare dollars in 1905 and 2003 is one of the book's few flaws. With a vivid cast of supporting characters, including some of America's greatest financial titans, this lively history offers all the vicarious thrills of family drama and boardroom intrigue without making readers apprehensive about their own investment portfolios. 24 b&amp;w illus.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Emergency!</h2><p>How police, firefighters and others respond to emergencies.</p><p>Gail Gibbons has published close to fifty distinguished nonfiction titles with Holiday House.

Our biologists had taken a mechanistic view of life. From a biology textbook quoted by Capra, &#34;One of the acid tests of understanding an object is the ability to put it together from its component parts. &#34; (Capra p. 102) An approach that ironically is quite opposed to the study of life. We&#39;ve now realized that the mapping of the human genome has yielded many beautiful computer models but little else. The biomedical model which concentrates on the mechanisms of smaller and smaller fragments of the body has yielded an approach that views disease as, &#34;the malfunctioning of biological organisms which are studied from the point of view of cellular and molecular biology; the doctor&#39;s role is to intervene, either physically or chemically, to correct the malfunctioning of a specific mechanism.&#34; (p.123) The ingestion of many chemicals and execution of complicated surgeries has resulted in ever rising health care costs, and while saving many lives has primarily served as an excuse for lifestyles that run counter to human nature. &#34;We prefer to talk about our children&#39;s hyperactivity or learning disability rather than examine the inadequacy of our schools; we prefer to be told that we suffer from hypertension rather than change our over-competitive business world; we accept ever increasing rates of cancer rather than investigate how the chemical industry poisons our food to increase its profits.&#34; (p.163)</p><p><b>Fritjof Capra</b>, PhD, physicist and systems theorist, is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California.

No one did.<br><br>I remember that day for quite another reason.<br><br>I was supposed to be dead. But somehow he had found me out.<br>It was early, and dark enough that most mudlarks weren&#x2019;t on the river yet. I liked this time best. The stink wasn&#x2019;t quite so bad for some reason. And it was quiet, since most folks in London were still sleeping. The bustle and noise of the old city would start up soon enough.<br><br>Thumbless Jake was there, of course. The rest of us scavengers wondered if he ever did sleep. And on this particular morning, Jake was on edge, I expect because of spending so much time wading in that sludgy stink we called a river. So when he spied me snatchin&#x2019; up something shiny from the murky water, he commenced hollering like a mad bull about to charge.<br><br>And I should know. I might never have been on a farm in all my nearly thirteen years, but I&#x2019;d seen my share of raging beasts at the old Smithfield livestock market, a fearful but exciting place. They&#x2019;d moved it two years before, on account of the mayhem caused by throngs of cattle, pigs, goats, horses, and sheep tramping through the heart of the city. I was sad to see it go.<br><br>&#x201c;Give it here, Eel!&#x201d; Jake shouted at once. He thrust out his long stick and lunged for my ankles.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t catch me,&#x201d; I taunted. I skittered out of reach, fast as I could, sticky brown mud squelching between my toes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be greedy. It&#x2019;s just a bit of rope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Liar. &#x2019;Tain&#x2019;t rope at all. I seen it glitter with me own eyes. That&#x2019;s copper you got there.&#x201d; Thumbless Jake pointed the forefinger of his right hand--his good one--at me. &#x201c;Play fair, Eel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why should I? No one&#x2019;s ever played fair with me.&#x201d; I said it, but that wasn&#x2019;t quite true. Even Jake himself had once done me a good deed.<br><br>&#x201c;Wicked, ungrateful lad,&#x201d; Jake growled, aiming a huge hunk of spit at me.<br><br>Jake had been a blacksmith once, or so I&#x2019;d heard from Ned (we called him Nasty Ned, on account of him being the worst-smelling lad on the river). &#x201c;Gin was Jake&#x2019;s downfall,&#x201d; Ned had told me. &#x201c;And then came the day he tippled so much he slammed a great hammer down on &#x2019;is own thumb.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to picture Jake&#x2019;s muscles as they must&#x2019;ve been, rippling across his back like ever so many snakes. These days he used his arms for stealing copper off the hulls of ships and trolling for bits of the shiny stuff in the brown slop of low tide.<br><br>&#x201c;You are an eel,&#x201d; Jake declared. He paused to wipe his face with a corner of his ragged shirt, though I&#x2019;m not sure why, as both were equally covered in filth. &#x201c;Slippery and more hard-hearted than most. And that&#x2019;s sayin&#x2019; a lot, with this &#x2019;ere pack of mudlarks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that as a compliment.&#x201d; I grinned.<br><br>&#x201c;Hand it over. You poached on my bit o&#x2019; river here,&#x201d; Jake said, his voice almost pleading now. &#x201c;You gotta stay on the edge. Them&#x2019;s the rules, lad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re always goin&#x2019; on about rules, Jake.&#x201d;<br><br>I was bluffing, though, and Jake knew it. In the end, I&#x2019;d have to give in. A big man like Jake could troll where he wanted. Kids like me had to keep to the edge of the grimy brown river, picking up pieces of coal, rope, rags, and wood at low tide. On a good day, I might collect enough coal to fill a pot and make a penny.<br><br>Now that I had my place at the Lion Brewery over on Broad Street, I&#x2019;d been mudlarking mostly just in the early mornings, when it was so hot even my stone cellar room seemed about to stifle me. It didn&#x2019;t bring in much, but I needed any extra tin I could get.<br><br>&#x201c;Have a heart, Eel.&#x201d; Jake fixed me with his wild blue eyes and tried again. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t we all riverfinders? Put on this earth to try to get by, one day at a time. We&#x2019;re all we&#x2019;ve got under this sky. We need to play fair and take care of one another.<br><br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;d known that sooner, I wouldn&#x2019;t have lost sweet Hazel and my kiddies,&#x201d; he went on, almost to himself, slapping the oily surface of the water with his stick.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I relented at last. &#x201c;You win. It&#x2019;s yours. Catch!&#x201d;<br><br>The big man lunged and missed, landing flat on his face, sputtering in the churning black water. I laughed and turned to go.<br><br>But Jake had the last word.<br><br>&#x201c;You better watch out, Eel.&#x201d; He rose up, hollering at the top of his lungs. &#x201c; &#x2019;E&#x2019;s been nosing around askin&#x2019; after you, &#x2019;e has. Don&#x2019;t blame me--I had nothing to do with it. But &#x2019;e says a little birdie told him you ain&#x2019;t dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I froze, digging my feet into the mud. &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You heard me, lad. You think you&#x2019;re clever, but just you watch out,&#x201d; Jake warned. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t let on I knows anything about you. But Fisheye Bill Tyler is onto you--and a nastier man never walked the streets of London. He might&#x2019;ve been an honest fishmonger once. Those days are gone. He&#x2019;s turned bad. Very bad indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did he say, Jake?&#x201d; I demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, Eel, he only wants what&#x2019;s &#x2019;is,&#x201d; Jake replied, trying to wipe streaks of dark mud from his grizzled face, this time with his fingers. &#x201c;Fisheye said he just wants what belongs to &#x2019;im by rights.&#x201d;<br><br>Jake hadn&#x2019;t touched a hair on my head. But it felt as though he&#x2019;d knocked the breath right out of me.<br><br>&#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t seen me, Jake,&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;You hear me? You know nothin&#x2019;. All you know is that the Thames got me.&#x201d;<br><br>I took a ragged breath, the stink of the river almost making me retch. &#x201c;You got that? I&#x2019;m dead, carried out to sea in the arms of this muddy flow. Dead and gone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you take of &#x2019;is, Eel? You must &#x2019;ave done something to make &#x2019;im that mad,&#x201d; Jake called after me, holding fast to the scrap of copper he&#x2019;d finally fished out of the grimy water.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t stop. My insides had begun to shake like the last little leaf on a tree when the cold fingers of a biting wind come to snatch it. How had he found me out?<br><br>I&#x2019;d made sure that Fisheye had been told I was dead, swallowed up by the dirty old river, covered by its churning waters. For the last six months, I&#x2019;d kept low and out of his way. And I&#x2019;d kept my secret safe.<br><br>Until now. How much did Fisheye know? And who had snitched? It might have been Jake himself. Trust was as rare on the river as finding a gold ring. No, I couldn&#x2019;t trust him.<br><br>Thumbless Jake was right about one thing, though. Fisheye Bill Tyler wanted to control whatever he thought belonged to him--pickpockets, petty thieves, housebreakers.<br><br>And me.</p><h2>Heart Trouble</h2><p>Cleaning lady-turned-sleuth Callahan Garrity investigates when Whitney Dobbs, the drunken ex-wife of a prominent cardiologist, who gets away with running over a little girl in the park, is gunned down while doing her community service. Reissue.</p><p><p><strong>Kathy Hogan Trocheck</strong> is the author of ten critically acclaimed mysteries, including the Callahan Garrity mystery series. A former reporter for the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, she is also the author of <em>Little Bitty Lies</em> and the Edgar�- and Macavity-nominated <em>Savannah Blues</em>, under the name Mary Kay Andrews.</p>Everybody in Atlanta hates Whitney Albright Dobbs, the well- connected society matron who downed a brace of Tanquerays at her club, ran down eight-year-old Faneeta Mayes, and then got off with a fine and a hundred hours of community service (the highway trash patrol) thanks to a bleeding-heart lawyer who blamed everybody except his client. But even Whitney Dobbs deserves a fair shake now that she's not so well-connected anymore; her cardiologist husband Carson Dobbs, long separated from her and cloven to her replacement, has taken advantage of her legal troubles to squirrel away his assets and file for divorce. So when Whitney asks Callahan Garrity, p.i.-cum-house cleaner (Happy Never After, 1995, etc.), to go on a treasure hunt for her ex's family jewels, Callahan reluctantly takes the case. Her plan to insinuate her ailing but indomitable mother into Dr. Dobbs's practice as a patient and to mobilize her staff at The House Mouse to spy on the good doctor is just bearing its first fruits when Whitney and another member of the highway cleaning patrol are shotgunned and stuffed into the roadside trash. Was the killer the heart-specialist husband, one of Faneeta Mayes's distraught parents, or just one of the dozens of picketers who'd been calling for Whitney's blood up till the day of her death? Callahan's fifth is conscientiously plotted, if the waves upon waves of witnesses don't wear out your patience. (Regional author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Original. (A Blizzard Entertainment M-rated electronic game) (Horror)</p><p>Mel Odom has written over 60 books which include the novelization of the movie BLADE and original novels for both the Buffy and Angel series. Mel Odom has written dozens of novels over the past eleven years in several fields: fantasy, game related fiction, science fiction, movie novelizations, horror, young adult, juvenile, computer strategy guides, action-adventure and comics. He began writing in the Joss-verse of evil and demonic amusement at Pocket Books when he wrote his first Angel novel, Redemption. He currently lives in Moore, Oklahoma with his wife and five children.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Darrick Lang pulled at the oar and scanned the night-shrouded cliffs overlooking the Dyre River, hoping he remained out of sight of the pirates they hunted. Of course, he would only know they'd been discovered after the initial attack, and the pirates weren't known for their generosity toward Westmarch navy sailors. Especially ones who were hunting them pursuant to the King of Westmarch's standing orders. The possibility of getting caught wasn't a pleasant thought. </p><p> The longboat sculled against the gentle current, but the prow cut so clean that the water didn't slap against the low hull. Sentries posted up on the surrounding cliffs would raise the alarm if the longboat were seen or heard, and there would be absolute hell to pay for it. If that happened, Darrick was certain none of them would make it back to Lonesome Star waiting out in the Gulf of Westmarch. Captain Tollifer, the vessel's master, was one of the sharpest naval commanders in all of Westmarch under the king's command, and he'd have no problem shipping out if Darrick and his band didn't return before dawn. </p><p> Bending his back and leaning forward, Darrick eased the oar from the water and spoke in a soft voice. "Easy, boys. Steady on, and we'll make a go of this. We'll be in and out before those damned pirates know we've come and gone." </p><p> "If our luck holds," Mat Hu-Ring whispered beside Darrick. </p><p> "I'll take luck," Darrick replied. "Never had anything against it, and it seems you've always had plenty to spare." </p><p> "You've never been one to go a-courtin' luck," Mat said. </p><p> "Never," Darrick agreed, feeling a little cocky in spite of the danger they were facing. "But I don't find myself forgetting friends who have it." </p><p> "Is that why you brought me along on this little venture of yours?" </p><p> "Aye," Darrick replied. "And as I got it toted, I saved your life the last time. I'm figuring you owe me one there." </p><p> Mat grinned in the darkness, and the white of his teeth split his dark face. Like Darrick, he wore lampblack to shadow his features and make him more a part of the night. But where Darrick had reddish hair and bronze skin, Mat had black hair and was nut brown. </p><p> "Oh, but you're up and bound to be pushin' luck this night, aren't you, my friend?" Mat asked. </p><p> "The fog is holding." Darrick nodded at the billowing silver-gray gusts that stayed low over the river. The wind and the water worked together tonight, and the fog rolled out to the sea. With the fog in the way, the distance seemed even farther. "Mayhap we can rely on the weather more than we have to rely on your luck." </p><p> "An' if ye keep runnin' yer mouths the way ye are," old Maldrin snarled in his gruff voice, "mayhap them guards what ain't sleepin' up there will hear ye and let go with some of them ambushes these damned pirates has got set up. Ye know people talkin' carries easier over the water than on land." </p><p> "Aye," Darrick agreed. "An' I know the sound don't carry up to them cliffs from here. They're a good forty feet above us, they are." </p><p> "Stupid Hillsfar outlander," Maldrin growled. "Ye're still wet behind the ears and runnin' at the nose for carryin' out this here kind of work. If'n ye ask me, ol' Cap'n Tollifer ain't quite plump off the bob these days." </p><p> "An' there you have it then, Ship's Mate Maldrin," Darrick said. "No one bloody asked you." </p><p> A couple of the other men aboard the longboat laughed at the old mate's expense. Although Maldrin had a reputation as a fierce sailor and warrior, the younger men on the crew considered him somewhat of a mother hen and a worrywart. </p><p> The first mate was a short man but possessed shoulders almost an ax handle's length across. He kept his gray-streaked beard cropped close. A horseshoe-shaped bald spot left him smooth on top but with plenty of hair on the sides and in back that he tied in a queue. Moisture from the river and the fog glistened on the tarred breeches and soaked the dark shirt. </p><p> Darrick and the other men in the longboat were clad in similar fashion. All of them had wrapped their blades in spare bits of sailcloth to keep the moonshine and water from them. The Dyre River was fresh water, not the corrosive salt of the Gulf of Westmarch, but a sailor's practices in the King's Royal Navy were hard to put aside. </p><p> "Insolent pup," Maldrin muttered. </p><p> "Ah, and you love me for it even as you decry it, Maldrin," Darrick said. "If you think you're miserable company now, just think about how you'd have been if I'd up and bloody left you on board Lonesome Star. I'm telling you, man, I don't see you up for a night of hand-wringing. Truly I don't. And this is the thanks I get for sparing you that." </p><p> "This isn't going to be as easy as ye seem to want to believe," Maldrin said. </p><p> "And what's to worry about, Maldrin? A few pirates?" Darrick shipped his oar, watchful that the longboat crew still moved together, then eased it back into the water and drew again. The longboat surged through the river water, making good time. They'd spotted the small campfire of the first sentry a quarter-mile back. The port they were looking for wasn't much farther ahead. </p><p> "These aren't just any pirates," Maldrin replied. </p><p> "No," Darrick said, "I have to agree with you. These here pirates, now these are the ones that Cap'n Tollifer sent us to fetch up some trouble with. After orders like them, I won't have you thinking I'd just settle for any pirates." </p><p> "Nor me," Mat put in. "I've proven myself right choosy when it comes to fighting the likes of pirates." </p><p> A few of the other men agreed, and they shared a slight laugh. </p><p> No one, Darrick noted, mentioned anything of the boy the pirates had kidnapped. Since the boy's body hadn't been recovered at the site of the earlier attack, everyone believed he was being held for ransom. Despite the need to let off steam before their insertion into the pirates' stronghold, thinking of the boy was sobering. </p><p> Maldrin only shook his head and turned his attention to his own oar. "Ach, an' ye're a proper pain in the arse, Darrick Lang. Before all that's of the Light and holy, I'd swear to that. But if'n there's a man aboard Cap'n Tollifer's ship what can pull this off, I figure it's gotta be you." </p><p> "I'd doff my hat to you, Maldrin," Darrick said, touched. "If I were wearing one, that is." </p><p> "Just keep wearin' the head it would fit on if ye were," Maldrin growled. </p><p> "Indeed," Darrick said. "I intend to." He took a fresh grip on his oar. "Pull, then, boys, while the river is steady and the fog stays with us." As he gazed up at the mountains, he knew that some savage part of him relished thoughts of the coming battle. </p><p> The pirates wouldn't give the boy back for free. And Captain Tollifer, on behalf of Westmarch's king, was demanding a blood price as well. </p><p> <br> "Damned fog," Raithen said, then swore with heartfelt emotion. </p><p> The pirate captain's vehemence drew Buyard Cholik from his reverie. The old priest blinked past the fatigue that held him in thrall and glanced at the burly man who stood limned in the torchlight coming from the suite of rooms inside the building. "What is the matter, Captain Raithen?" </p><p> Raithen stood like a mountain at the stone balcony railing of the building that overlooked the alabaster and columned ruins of the small port city where they'd been encamped for months. He pulled at the goatee covering his massive chin and absently touched the cruel scar on the right corner of his mouth that gave him a cold leer. </p><p> "The fog. Makes it damned hard to see the river." The pale moonlight glinted against the black chainmail Raithen wore over a dark green shirt. The ship's captain was always sartorially perfect, even this early in the morning. Or this late at night, Cholik amended, for he didn't know which was the case for the pirate chieftain. Raithen's black breeches were tucked with neat precision into his rolled-top boots. "And I still think maybe we didn't get away so clean from the last bit of business we did." </p><p> "The fog also makes navigating the river risky," Cholik said. </p><p> "Maybe to you, but for a man used to the wiles and ways of the sea," Raithen said, "that river down there would offer smooth sailing." He pulled at his beard as he looked down at the sea again, then nodded. "If it was me, I'd make a run at us tonight." </p><p> "You're a superstitious man," Cholik said, and couldn't help putting some disdain in his words. He wrapped his arms around himself. Unlike Raithen, Cholik was thin to the point of emaciation. The night's unexpected chill predicting the onset of the coming winter months had caught him off-guard and ill prepared. He no longer had the captain's young years to tide him over, either. The wind, now that he noticed it, cut through his black and scarlet robes. </p><p> Raithen glanced back at Cholik, his expression souring as if he were prepared to take offense at the assessment. </p><p> "Don't bother to argue," Cholik ordered. "I've seen the tendency in you. I don't hold it against you, trust me. But I choose to believe in things that offer me stronger solace than superstition." </p><p> A scowl twisted Raithen's face. His own dislike and distrust concerning what Cholik's acolytes did in the lower regions of the town they'd found buried beneath the abandoned port city were well known. The site was far to the north of Westmarch, well out of the king's easy reach. As desolate as the place was, Cholik would have thought the pirate captain would be pleased about the location. But the priest had forgotten the civilized amenities the pirates had available to them at the various ports that didn't know who they were -- or didn't care because their gold and silver spent just as quickly as anyone else's. Still, the drinking and debauchery the pirates were accustomed to were impossible where they now camped. </p><p> "None of your guards has sounded an alarm," Cholik went on. "And I assume all have checked in." </p><p> "They've checked in," Raithen agreed. "But I'm certain that I spotted another ship's sails riding our tailwind when we sailed up into the river this afternoon." </p><p> "You should have investigated further." </p><p> "I did." Raithen scowled. "I did, and I didn't find anything." </p><p> "There. You see? There's nothing to worry about." </p><p> Raithen shot Cholik a knowing glance. "Worrying about things is part of what you pay me all that gold for." </p><p> "Worrying me, however, isn't." </p><p> Despite his grim mood, a small smile twisted Raithen's lips. "For a priest of Zakarum Church, which professes a way of gentleness, you've got an unkind way about your words." </p><p> "Only when the effect is deserved." </p><p> Folding his arms across his massive chest, Raithen leaned back against the balcony and chuckled. "You do intrigue me, Cholik. When we became acquainted all those months ago and you told me what you wanted to do, I thought you were a madman." </p><p> "A legend of a city buried beneath another city isn't madness," Cholik said. However, the things he'd had to do to secure the sacred and almost forgotten texts of Dumal Lunnash, a Vizjerei wizard who had witnessed the death of Jere Harash thousands of years ago, had almost driven him there. </p><p> Thousands of years ago, Jere Harash had been a young Vizjerei acolyte who had discovered the power to command the spirits of the dead. The young boy had claimed the insight was given to him through a dream. There was no doubting the new abilities Jere Harash mustered, and his power became a thing of legend. The boy perfected the process whereby the wizards drained the energy of the dead, making anyone who used it more powerful than anything that had gone on before. As a result of this new knowledge, the Vizjerei -- one of the three primary clans in the world thousands of years ago -- had become known as the Spirit Clans. </p><p> Dumal Lunnash had been a historian and one of the men to have survived Jere Harash's last attempt to master the spirit world completely. Upon the young man's attaining the trance state necessary to transfer the energy to the spells he wove, a spirit had taken control of his body and gone on a killing rampage. Later, the Vizjerei had learned that the spirits they called on and unwittingly unleashed into the world were demons from the Burning Hells. </p><p> As a chronicler of the times and the auguries of the Vizjerei, Dumal Lunnash had largely been overlooked, but his texts had led Cholik through a macabre and twisted trail that had ended in the desolation of the forgotten city on the Dyre River. </p><p> "No," Raithen said. "Legends like that are everywhere. I've even followed a few of them myself, but I've never seen one come true." </p><p> "Then I'm surprised that you came at all," Cholik said. This was a conversation they'd been avoiding for months, and he was surprised to find it coming out now. But only in a way. From the signs they'd been finding the last week, while Raithen had been away plundering and pillaging, or whatever it was that Raithen's pirates did while they were away, Cholik had known they were close to discovering the dead city's most important secret. </p><p> "It was your gold," Raithen admitted. "That was what turned the trick for me. Now, since I've returned again, I've seen the progress your people are making." </p><p> A bitter sweetness filled Cholik. Although he was glad to be vindicated in the pirate captain's eyes, the priest also knew that Raithen had already started thinking about the possibility of treasure.

"Aye, maybe I'll be swinging at the end of a gallows like a loose sail at the end of a yardarm, but don't you think the king would have a special punishment meted out to a priest of the Zakarum Church who had betrayed his confidence and had been telling the pirates what ships carry the king's gold through the Gulf of Westmarch and through the Great Ocean?" </p><p> Raithen's remarks stung Cholik. The Archangel Yaerius had coaxed a young ascetic named Akarat into founding a religion devoted to the Light. And for a time, Zakarum Church had been exactly that, but it had changed over the years and through the wars. Few mortals, only those within the inner circles of the Zakarum Church, knew that the church had been subverted by demons and now followed a dark, mostly hidden evil through their inquisitions. The Zakarum Church was also tied into Westmarch and Tristram, the power behind the power of the kings.

This monument would soon become known as the Taj Mahal&#x2014;a sight famous around the world for its beauty and the emotions it symbolizes.</p> <p>Princess Jahanara, the courageous daughter of the emperor and his wife, recounts their mesmerizing tale, while sharing her own parallel story of forbidden love with the celebrated architect of the Taj Mahal. Set during a time of unimaginable wealth and power, murderous sibling rivalries, and cruel despotism, this impressive novel sweeps you away to a historical Hindustan brimming with action and intrigue in an era when, alongside the brutalities of war and oppression, architecture and the art of love and passion reached a pinnacle of perfection.<br> </p></p><p>John Shors is the bestselling author of <i>Beneath a Marble Sky</i>, <i>Beside a Burning Sea</i>, <i>Dragon House</i>, <i>The Wishing Trees</i>, and <i>Cross Currents</i>. He has won numerous awards for his writing, and his novels have been translated into twenty-six languages. John encourages reader feedback and can be easily reached via his website at johnshors.com.&nbsp;"Jahanara is a beguiling heroine whom readers will come to love; none of today's chick-lit heroines can match her dignity, fortitude and cunning. Elegant, often lyrical, writing distinguishes this literary fiction from the genre known as historical romance. It is truly a work of art, rare in a debut novel."<br>- <i>The Des Moines Register</i><br><br>"Beneath a Marble Sky is a story which literally speaks to you. In his first novel, John Shors brilliantly recounts one of the world's greatest love stories, narrated against a backdrop of hatred and violence."<i> - India Post</i><br><br>"(A) story of romance and passion. (Beneath a Marble Sky) is a wonderful book if you want to escape to a foreign land while relaxing in your porch swing."<i> - St. Petersburg Times</i><br><br>"A majestic novel that irresistibly draws the reader within its saga of human struggles, failings, alliances and betrayals." - <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>"Beneath a Marble Sky is a passionate, lush, and dramatic novel, rich with a sense of place. John Shors is an author of sweeping imaginative force."<i> - Sandra Gulland, author of The Josephine B. Trilogy</i><br><br>As any reader of travel brochures knows, the Taj Mahal is a monument built by a grieving widower in remembrance of his beloved wife. Travel Channel viewers may be aware of more detail, like the fact that it was built in 1632 by the Emperor of Hindustan, Shah Jahan, to symbolize his love for his wife, Mumatz Mahal, whom he called "Taj." But only readers of this exquisite tale will be able to gain a thorough understanding of what life must have been like in that time and place, where love was neither easily obtained nor free of political ties. <br><br> The author centers his tale on Princess Jahanara, the oldest daughter of the Shah and Mahal, as she tells the story of their great love to her granddaughters. Jahanara also talks about her own romance, but hers was of the forbidden type that's rife with conflict, abuse, and censure. These intimate events are set against the backdrop of the era-a difficult time of war, rebellion, and religious tension. The result is a rich story that informs readers of little-discussed history, but doesn't weigh them down with it. Rather, Shors is adept at letting the parallel tales unfold through his increasingly complex characters. Most touching are scenes like the one in which Jahanara sees the first large sketches of the monument, done by her lover, an architect she can't marry: "It gave life to something wondrous, something he'd called a tear of Allah. To me, the mausoleum became a jewel surpassing even Mother's beauty. Its arches and towers and facades were not of this world." <br><br> Shors infuses this novel (his first) with his love of the foreign; after his college graduation, he lived in Japan and then backpacked across the continent, spending a large amount of time in India. Returning to America, he worked as a newspaper reporter in Iowa, winning a statewide journalism award for investigative reporting, and then as a public relations executive. This personal exploration is apparent in the novel, since Shors's descriptions are like those of a passionate traveler who appreciates exotic locales. <br><br> Although he brings Jahanara to life gradually, and makes her pain and ecstasy feel real, Shors also creates a vivid and striking world that feels as close as a plane ride. Most important, he manages to convey universal feelings in a tangible and intimate way. Shah Jahan's grief isn't just that of a man who lived centuries ago; it's a well of emotion felt long before Mumatz Mahal ever lived, and is still felt today. Shors's ability to tap into that well, and make it so alive, renders the novel as luminous a jewel as any that adorn the Taj Mahal's walls. -- <em>ForeWord Magazine</em><br><br>In his debut, Shors offers a glimpse into the politics and intrigue of the 17th-century court of India during and after the construction of the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for the beloved wife of Mughul emperor Shah Jahan. Told through the eyes of the emperor's daughter, the story contrasts the opulence of the court with the desperate poverty of the citizens; we also see the influence of women on political decisions and the perpetual tensions between religious fundamentalism and tolerance. The book is a thrilling tale of the interactions of characters recognizable for their loyalty, duplicity, and passion and will appeal to a wide audience. The author has included enough accurate details to make regular readers of historical fiction happy, too. Highly recommended for all libraries. -- <i><i>Library Journal</i>, Kim Uden Rutter, Antioch, IL Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information</i></p><h2>The Queer Movie Poster Book</h2><p>Films about "the love that dare not speak its name" have been around for decades, but only recently have they formed an out-and-proud genre. In the first overview of its kind, <i>The Queer Movie Poster Book</i> traces the history of gay film through its posters and promotional art. Sometimes alluring, sometimes lurid, often coded, the posters speak volumes about the social mores of the times and the struggle for queer identity. Historian Jenni Olson includes over 150 posters -- from Wallace Beery drag follies to the latest indy productions -- which showcase the varied spectrum of queer cinema. Fascinating sidebars discuss dykesploitation films (typically made by straight men for straight men), gay porn (an overlooked means to social liberation in its own right), and films with transgender themes (studded with pulled-from-the-headlines movies). From the earnest to the campy, <i>The Queer Movie Poster Book</i> constitutes a vibrant feast of popular art and a valuable document of gay film culture.</p><p>Jenni Olson is one of the world's leading experts on queer film.

Paperback. This novel was written in 1858, when the author was a teenager. It is an enormously influential early fantasy novel, influencing the works of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Madeleine L&#39;Engle and others. In this tale, the &#34;fairy land&#34; represents the spiritual world, or our own world revealed in all of its depth and meaning. At times almost forthrightly allegorical, at other times richly dreamlike, this story of a young man who finds himself on a long journey through a land of fantasy is more truly the story of the spiritual quest that is at the core of his life&#39;s work, a quest that must end with the ultimate surrender of the self.</p><p>George MacDonald was a Scottish author and minister best known for his fairy tales and fantasy novels.

He enjoys sledding in the snow, the occasional snowball fight, and hanging out with his friends and neighbors. Then the Nazis come. It&#39;s 1940 and Norway has been invaded by a particularly nasty enemy. This wouldn&#39;t be such a problem if Norway were a poor nation. Unfortunately they have gold bullion in their banks worth roughly $9,000,000. It would be great if the bank could get the unprocessed gold to a cargo ship waiting by the sea, but any form of transportation used would probably get searched by the invading army. But what if the carriers were the most innocent available? What if the children were put to use? Before Peter and his friends know it they&#39;re running a dangerous mission right under the noses of the Nazis. But will the Nazis ever figure out what exactly is going on? And, almost more importantly, will the snow last?</p><p>Marie McSwigan was an award-winning author of children&#39;s books who lived in Pennsylvania.This beautiful and thrilling story written in 1942 is set in Norway. As the Nazis move closer to the country, it is decided that something must be done to keep Norwegian gold from the enemy. Children are the only ones who can go about their daily lives without arousing suspicion. Narrator McDonough uses restraint as he retells this compelling story about REAL heros and heroines. The pace of the story and McDonough&#39;s style keep the listener on edge as the children hide gold bricks in the snowmen they are building right under the German noses. McDonough&#39;s mature and accentless voice is perfect since the story is filled with many nationalities and ages. A superb choice for older children and anyone interested in WWII lore. S.G.B.

The stories are imbued with a deep political conscience and present a scathing critique of corruption in society, juxtaposed with meditations on the nature of violence and exile.<br><br>The authors have also rearranged the stories in chronological order of the characters and events, rather than dates of first publication, providing a novel reading experience for both new fans and old. <i>The Age of Innocence</i> collects eleven stories, including &#x201c;Talkin&#x2019; with Joe,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Webster Case,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Fillmore Case,&#x201d; &#x201c;Viet Blues,&#x201d; &#x201c;Life Ain&#x2019;t a Comic Book, Baby,&#x201d; &#x201c;Twinkle, Twinkle,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Dark City.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Alack Sinner</i> is an international bestseller and between them Mu�oz and Sampayo are winners of Europe&#x2019;s top comics awards.</p><p><b>Carlos Sampayo</b> is an Argentine writer best known for his work in comics, particularly in collaboration with artist Jos� Mu�oz. &nbsp;The writer Carlos Sampayo is best known for the disturbing stories he made with artist Jos� Mu�oz. Sampayo met Mu�oz in Spain after he fled from the military junta. They created 'Joe's Bar' (short stories about clients of a caf� in New York), 'Alack Sinner' (a hard-boiled detective in the style of film-noir), 'Jeu de Lumi�res', 'Billie Holiday' and other stories. Sampayo also worked with Oscar Zarate, Jorge Schiaffino and Solano L�pez. Sampayo's work is unusually mature for the world of comics, because of its grimness. The expressionistic black and white drawing style of Jos� Mu�oz is the perfect form for these stories, which are not depressing because there's always some way out of the misery.<br><br>Born in 1942 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as a child <b>Jos� Mu�oz</b> manifested a great passion for design, and a particular interest in the world of comics. He emerged as an independent artist in 1963 with his detective series "Precinct 56". In 1974 he met the Argentine writer Carlos Sampayo and this fundamental event would mark the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration. Thus the character of Alack Sinner was born - a private detective whose human adventures were played out to the sound of jazz, and described both the misery and nobility of a New York that was imagined in such a way as to almost have been real."You can see very clearly why Mu�oz and Sampayo have had such an inspirational effect on comics creators around the world (most notably in the USA on Keith Giffen and&nbsp;Frank Miller) but they remain unequalled, and&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence&nbsp;</i>is titanic, memorable&nbsp;work."&nbsp;&#x2014;Woodrow Phoenix,&nbsp;<i>The Slings and Arrows Graphic Novel Guide</i></p><h2>Soul Patch</h2><p>The Fourth Moe Prager Mystery set in New York City.</p><p>Author lives in New York City.Set in late 1980s New York City, Coleman's gritty fourth Moe Prager mystery is somewhat less surprising and realistic than its acclaimed predecessor, <i>The James Deans</i> (2005), which won Shamus, Barry and Anthony awards. Prager, an ex-cop turned PI, has a cryptic encounter with his old friend Larry McDonald, the NYPD chief of detectives. Larry slips him a covertly recorded tape of an interrogation of a snitch claiming to know the secret behind the murder of Dexter Mayweather, a major-league drug dealer in the early 1970s. When McDonald himself turns up an apparent suicide, Prager calls in a variety of favors from old friends to sift the truth behind Mayweather's death, even as his marriage hits a lull, leaving him vulnerable to an attractive young Hispanic detective.

Nine additional patterns are provided that are based on designs dating to ancient times, such as the Scotch Thistle and Reticella.</p><p>Margaret Morgan has long been fascinated by the techniques of filet lace, and its long history.

In the conduct of these duties he has kept his eyes open, his ears tuned to the indispensable vernaculars of love and grief. In these twelve essays is the voice of both witness and functionary. Lynch stands between &#39;the living and the living who have dies&#39; with the same outrage and amazement, straining for the same glimpse we all get of what mortality means to a vital species. So here is homage to parents who have died and to children who shouldn&#39;t have. Here are golfers tripping over grave-markers, gourmands and hypochondriacs, lovers and suicides. These are essays of rare elegance and grace, full of fierce compassion and rich in humour and humanity - lessons taught to the living by the dead.</p><p>"...I had come to know that the undertaking that my father did had less to do with what was done to the dead and more to do with what the living did about the fact of life that people died," Thomas Lynch muses in his preface to <i>The Undertaking</i>. The same could be said for Lynch's book: ostensibly about death and its attendant rituals, <i>The Undertaking</i> is in the end about life. In each case, he writes, it is the one that gives meaning to the other. A funeral director in Milford, Michigan, Lynch is that strangest of hyphenates, a poet-undertaker, but according to Lynch, all poets share his occupation, "looking for meaning and voices in life and love and death." Looking for meaning takes him to all sorts of unexpected places, both real and imagined. He embalms the body of his own father, celebrates the rebuilt bridge to his town's old cemetery, takes issue with the Jessica Mitfords of this world, and envisages a "golfatorium," a combination golf course and cemetery that could restore joy to the last rites. In "Crapper," Lynch even contemplates the subtleties of the modern flush toilet and its relationship to the messy business of dying: "Just about the time we were bringing the making of water and the movement of bowels into the house, we were pushing the birthing and marriage and sickness and dying out." Death and fatherhood, death and friendship, death and faith and love and poetry--these are the concerns that power Lynch's undertaking. Throughout, Lynch pleads the case for our dead--who are, after all, still living through us--with an eloquence marked by equal parts whimsy, wit, and compassion. In the last essay, "Tract," he envisions almost wistfully the funeral he'd choose for himself, and then relinquishes that, too. Funerals, after all, are for the living. The dead, he reminds us, don't care. <i>--Mary Park</i>'Every year I bury a couple hundred of my townspeople.' So opens the singular testimony of the American poet, Thomas Lynch. Like all poets, inspired by death, Lynch is, unlike others, also hired to bury the dead or cremate them to tend to their families in a small Michigan town where he serves as the funeral director. In the conduct of these duties he has kept his eyes open, his ears tuned to the indispensable vernaculars of love and grief. In these twelve essays is the voice of the both witness and functionary. Lynch stands between 'the living and the living who have died' with the same outrage and amazement, straining for the same glimpse we all get of what mortality means to a vital species. These are essays of rare elegance and grace, full of fierce compassion and rich in humour and humanity - lessons taught to the living by the dead.

The leading Republican candidates campaigned as isolationists. The charismatic Willkie, newcomer and upstager, was a liberal interventionist, just as anti-Hitler as FDR. After five days of floor rallies, telegrams from across the country, multiple ballots, rousing speeches, backroom deals, terrifying international news, and, most of all, the relentless chanting of "We Want Willkie" from the gallery, Willkie walked away with the nomination. <p> The story of how this happened &#x2014; and of how essential his nomination would prove in allowing FDR to save Britain and prepare this country for entry into World War II &#x2014; is all told in Charles Peters' <b>Five Days in Philadelphia</b>.

Winner of the <b>W. H.

That&#39;s the plausible premise of Elisabeth Luard&#39;s first novel.What if Edward Windsor and Wallis Simpson, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, had conceived a child, born in 1936 before her divorce, who was unfeelingly cast away just as Edward gave up his crown? This is the question posed by Luard (The Old World Kitchen; Marguerite) in her sprawling story of the unfortunate birth and fabulous life of Emerald Fitzwallace. As a baby, Emerald is shuffled off into the care of the duke's former mistress, Iona Fergusson, and her husband, Freddie. When WWII threatens London, Emerald and her foster brother, Callum, are evacuated by ship. A storm wrecks the boat, but both children survive and are washed ashore on a Scottish island. For a few years, after Iona and Freddie are killed in the war, the children are raised by the islanders. Then Emerald is spirited away from the island; over the course of her transformation from abandoned child to international starDshe ultimately becomes a Parisian model and a successful business womanDshe is watched over by the duke's machiavellian courtier and is chased by a sadistic reporter who has known Emerald since childhood and is dedicated to destroying what he cannot have. Titillating but relatively chaste, this glamorous tale of European high society, it will appeal to readers who find Jackie Collins a little too risqu and will feed the enduring American fascination with the British monarchy's dirty linen. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga</h2><p>For Want of a Nail is an alternate history classic. The outcome of one battle in the American Revolution diverges from reality, and sparks an unstoppable chain of events which affects the history of the whole North American continent. In reality, the British general John Burgoyne, heavily outnumbered by American troops, surrendered his army to General Horatio Gates at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, a major turning-point of the Revolution. Robert Sobel takes a step sideways and presents the alternative version: reinforcements arrive at Saratoga, Gates&#39; men flee, and Burgoyne is victorious. Rather than openly allying itself with the American rebels, France withdraws its support, as does Spain, and the colonies surrender. Those former rebels who refuse to live in the Confederation of North America established by the British leave their homes and settle in what becomes the United States of Mexico. From then on the two continental nations find themselves constant rivals, locked in military, political and economic conflict. Sobel provides a detailed, intricately documented insight into two warring powers that develop in such dramatically different ways from their shared origins.</p><p>Professor Robert Sobel taught History and Economics at Hofstra University in New York. He was the author of many books and had been a business columnist for Newsday.</p><h2>The Lady and the Panda: The True Adventures of the First American Explorer to Bring Back China&#39;s Most Exotic Animal</h2><p>Here is the astonishing true story of Ruth Harkness, the Manhattan bohemian socialite who, against all but impossible odds, trekked to Tibet in 1936 to capture the most mysterious animal of the day: a bear that had for countless centuries lived in secret in the labyrinth of lonely cold mountains. In The Lady and the Panda, Vicki Constantine Croke gives us the remarkable account of Ruth Harkness and her extraordinary journey, and restores Harkness to her rightful place along with Sacajawea, Nellie Bly, and Amelia Earhart as one of the great woman adventurers of all time.<br><br>Ruth was the toast of 1930s New York, a dress designer newly married to a wealthy adventurer, Bill Harkness. Just weeks after their wedding, however, Bill decamped for China in hopes of becoming the first Westerner to capture a giant panda&#x2013;an expedition on which many had embarked and failed miserably. Bill was also to fail in his quest, dying horribly alone in China and leaving his widow heartbroken and adrift. And so Ruth made the fateful decision to adopt her husband&#x2019;s dream as her own and set off on the adventure of a lifetime.<br><br>It was not easy. Indeed, everything was against Ruth Harkness. In decadent Shanghai, the exclusive fraternity of white male explorers patronized her, scorned her, and joked about her softness, her lack of experience and money. But Ruth ignored them, organizing, outfitting, and leading a bare-bones campaign into the majestic but treacherous hinterlands where China borders Tibet. As her partner she chose Quentin Young, a twenty-two-year-old Chinese explorer as unconventional as she was, who would join her in a romance as torrid as it was taboo.<br><br>Traveling across some of the toughest terrain in the world&#x2013;nearly impenetrable bamboo forests, slick and perilous mountain slopes, and boulder-strewn passages&#x2013;the team raced against a traitorous rival, and was constantly threatened by hordes of bandits and hostile natives. The voyage took months to complete and cost Ruth everything she had. But when, almost miraculously, she returned from her journey with a baby panda named Su Lin in her arms, the story became an international sensation and made the front pages of newspapers around the world. No animal in history had gotten such attention. And Ruth Harkness became a hero. <br><br>Drawing extensively on American and Chinese sources, including diaries, scores of interviews, and previously unseen intimate letters from Ruth Harkness, Vicki Constantine Croke has fashioned a captivating and richly textured narrative about a woman ahead of her time. Part Myrna Loy, part Jane Goodall, by turns wisecracking and poetic, practical and spiritual, Ruth Harkness is a trailblazing figure. And her story makes for an unforgettable, deeply moving adventure.</p><p>VICKI CONSTANTINE CROKE has been covering pets and wildlife for more than a decade, and writes the &#x201c;Animal Beat&#x201d; column for The Boston Globe<i>.</i> A former writer and producer for CNN, she has been a contributing reporter for the National Public Radio environment show Living on Earth and consults on film and television projects, most recently a two-hour documentary on gorillas for the A&amp;E channel.

He was dying, and alone in his agony. His original expedition mates, four adventurous men with dreams of capturing the giant panda, had all deserted him long before. Though he knew people in the city from previous trips and more recent escapades in notorious nightclubs and bars, in the end he had stayed true to some deeper nature, pushing them all away and stealing off in secret. His family, including his young wife back in Manhattan, had no idea he was even sick. With what little strength he could summon, he had been writing sunny notes home that masked his horrible condition. Perhaps he really believed his own words, for just weeks earlier he had been pressuring the doctor to release him so he could get back to his campaign. But, finally, on this frigid night, scarred by other attempts to scalpel tumors from his neck and torso and wretched from his latest incision, he found himself unable to eat or drink, then even to breathe. The sportsman who lived to rough it in the wild died under starched white sheets, in a ward reeking of antiseptic. His young life had ended in the pursuit of the most mysterious animal of his time, yet he had never managed to set a laced boot in the great snow-covered mountains that separated China and Tibet.<br><br>A world away, back in the noise and lights and rush of Manhattan, it had been an even chillier winter, one of the snowiest and coldest anyone could remember. Late in the afternoon, on the very day her husband took his last breath, Ruth Harkness was making her way home from a salon where she had enjoyed a luxurious shampoo. Bundled up, she happily picked her way along icy sidewalks that were dusted with ash for traction and walled in by freshly shoveled snow. Friends were due for cocktails shortly, and in the larger scheme of things, she had even more to look forward to. Now that things were beginning to go well for Bill, she thought, he might just be home within months. Then the two of them could travel the world as they had always imagined.<br><br>But as she stepped inside her comfortable West Side apartment, before she had time to hang up her coat, her &#x201c;pretty little mulatto maid&#x201d; and her houseguest, Margaret Freeland, confronted her with the horrible news: Bill was dead. A cable message had been relayed by telephone.<br><br>Her first reaction was stunned disbelief. It was too awful to accept. This must be some fantasy of the press&#x2014;reporters were fascinated by Bill and the other men of high adventure, but in their hunger for sensational stories, they were always getting things wrong. It had to be one of those false bulletins. Surely, over the course of the afternoon, that would become clear.<br><br>So she waited, as the winter darkness descended and lamps inside the apartment were snapped on. But hours later a telegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull made it official. The love of her life was gone.<br><br>The devastation of that loss would consume her for weeks, and haunt her always. &#x201c;Do you have that tremendous necessity of needing one person,&#x201d; Ruth Harkness would ask a friend in the bruised aftermath of Bill&#x2019;s death, &#x201c;some person who understands you and trusts you completely in everything you do and you are&#x2014;and ever can or will be? Someone with whom you can let down all barriers? All pretense of any kind and still be liked or loved? . . . That is what Bill meant to me and in return I gave him what he needed.&#x201d;<br><br>Through their ten years together, few understood the singular nature of their bond. To the outside world, Ruth and Bill were opposites. But they were also as perfect a fit.<br><br>Both had arrived in Manhattan in their early twenties. It was the Jazz Age, when under the cover of darkness, whites began slipping into Harlem for the music. People spoke openly of birth control, and women were enticed by the makers of Chesterfield cigarettes to &#x201c;blow some my way.&#x201d; Josephine Baker had her own nightclub in Paris. Films turned talkie. Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic. D. H. Lawrence imagined a scandalous dalliance in Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover, and Margaret Mead was discussing sex among young Samoans. It was the birth of Time magazine, The New Yorker, and the Milky Way bar. For young party-minded Manhattanites during Prohibition, speakeasies were all the rage. It was no surprise, then, that the worlds of two hell-raisers would eventually collide.<br><br>Handsome, short, and slender, with slicked-back straw-colored hair and light blue eyes, William Harvest Harkness, Jr., was born to privilege. The sound of his name alone declared it. He was not a member of the famous Standard Oil Harknesses. But Bill had graduated from Harvard, class of 1924; he was a rich boy whose name showed up in the society pages, the son of a successful New York City attorney, and the scion of a wealthy New York family, as the press described him. The Harknesses were powerfully connected and accustomed to doors being opened for them.<br><br>But those points alone certainly would not have been enough to attract Ruth. Bill Harkness also had grit, and smarts, and a wry take on the world. Never arrogant, he was nonetheless sure of himself, and unconcerned with proving anything to others. His singular nature defied easy definition. As one friend pointed out, Bill had &#x201c;inherited the wiry toughness of his Scotch-Irish ancestry along with a lot of mysticism, anomalously mixed with hard-headed Yankee shrewdness.&#x201d;<br><br>Both bookish and athletic, cynical and sensitive, Bill Harkness was a man of appealing contradictions. His complicatedness was something that Ruth would love.<br><br>In Ruth, Bill saw a novel act. She was nothing like the girls he had met at Harvard dances. With her black hair parted in the middle and pulled severely back, a penchant for the dramatic, even exotic, in her dress, and a fondness for bright red lipstick, Ruth Elizabeth McCombs stood out. She was a newly minted dress designer who possessed a rare polish and poise. Speaking with a cultured lilt, she had a deep voice and a light wit. She could fill a room with her presence, her outsized personality invariably prompting people to say that she was tall, even though she stood only five feet four. She had, according to one society watcher, &#x201c;that quality which Hollywood chooses to call glamour.&#x201d; Over the years, her panache would carry her through lofty circles in New York City and beyond, bringing her top-notch invitations wherever she went. She appeared the ultimate city slicker but had started life as anything but.<br><br>Born on September 21, 1900, the third of four children, she came from hardworking, frugal stock in Titusville, Pennsylvania, with American roots going back to the eighteenth century. Her father, Robert, was a carpenter, lean, fit, and kind. Her mother, Mary Anne Patterson McCombs, was a bit bulky and more than a bit stern. A stay-at-home seamstress, she was as old-fashioned as the long skirts she wore. The McCombses lived comfortably, in a big brown two-story house that was more sturdy than fancy. It symbolized the McCombs way of life: solid and straightforward. The land, blessed by a nearby creek, dotted with fragrant apple trees, and able to accommodate a small kitchen garden, had been in the family for generations. Robert had been born on the very site where the big house now stood, in a log cabin, in 1872.<br><br>Though not poor, the McCombses were far from wealthy. And Titusville knew wealth&#x2014;oil money, in fact. The nation&#x2019;s first commercially productive oil well had been drilled there, propelling a few families into an elite circle. They wintered in warm places and sent their children to private school. Their mansions were huge and ornate. But in the small-town culture, rich mixed easily with poor, and Ruth gained an intimacy with affluence, forever finding herself both repelled by and attracted to the rarefied world of the rich.<br><br>No matter where she went in life, she would always carry with her a number of family traits. Chief among them were resolve and stoicism. The hardscrabble McCombses were people who picked themselves up and dusted themselves off. Honesty was the number-one commandment. The family strengths were timeless, but to Ruth, it could also seem that her parents were hopelessly mired in the last century.<br><br>Chafing at the crabbed environment at home, where liquor and religion were shunned in equal measure, she found refuge in books, which took her to the far corners of the world. But even the family&#x2019;s temporary move to nearby Erie could not relieve the claustrophobia that she had begun to experience in Titusville. It was a pensive Ruth McCombs who looked out from the city&#x2019;s 1918 high school yearbook. Her entry, unlike the chirpy and chummy ones of her fellow students, read, &#x201c;Ruth is rather hard to get acquainted with, but after you know her you find that she has many good qualities and is a friend worth having.&#x201d; If few people in northwest Pennsylvania really understood her, that was fine by Ruth. Like her older siblings, Jim and Helen, she planned to cut loose at the first possible opportunity.<br><br>After a semester at the University of Colorado and an experiment teaching English in Cuba, Ruth, with twenty-five dollars as her war chest, headed north to New York City.<br><br>Raven-haired and slim, Ruth Elizabeth McCombs was twenty-three years old when she first remade herself. Powdered and dressed up, she took on Manhattan, finding a job in fashion, where she could design and sew dresses for a population that bought up all the Paris knockoffs Seventh Avenue could produce. She took to her new life like a natural&#x2014;utterly at ease at the center of a par...</p><h2>The SEARCH FOR CINDY AUSTIN (NANCY DREW 88)</h2><p>When Cindy Austin, the mischievous daughter of two government scientists, disappears for a second time, Nancy is convinced that this time its not a prank and Cindy is in trouble</p><p></p><h2>Prussian Homosexuality: 1417 - 1933</h2><p>Germany could just as well be called Prussia today because Prussia was its heart and mind, a warrior class that ceased to exist in 1947 when the Allied Control Council, the victors of WWII, abolished the entity with a few rapidly penned signatures at the bottom of a document. But as seen in this fully-illustrated book, far more than some hastily scribbled names will be needed to erase the story of the fiercest fighting force since the Spartans, two brother nations in arms, the Spartans who fought to the death so a lover would never be found lacking in courage and loyalty in the eyes of the boy at his side, and the Prussians headed by a man history calls Frederick the Great, one so powerful that Napoleon himself, gazing down at his grave, proclaimed that he would not be there had Frederick lived, Frederick whose love for men and boys was shared by many of his Prussian soldiers and Prussian compatriots. The most tolerant gay-friendly nation in the world is, of course, America, San Francisco its Holy Land, but Berlin comes in a clear second today, a capital that celebrates the gay-way every June in a march called Christopher Street Day in remembrance of the Stonewall Revolt. And throughout history, excluding the hellish interval of the Nazi maelstrom, Prussia has been tolerant of homosexuals, the word itself invented in 1869 by Karl-Maria Kertbeny in Vienna and publically defended for the first time in 1867 by the jurist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs in Munich. In 1897 Magnus Hirschfeld founded the first organization in the defense of homosexuality, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee, and in Berlin in 1874 Adolf Brand founded Der Eigene, The Special One, the first magazine to celebrate love between men. In Chicago in 1924 the Prussian Henry Gerber created the first homosexual organization in America, the Society of Human Rights, the building declared a National Historic Landmark in 2015. The Renaissance of homoeroticism took place in Prussia, and from 1800 to 1933 Berlin progressively mutated into the homosexual capital of the world, the seat of Romanticism, the rebirth of Periclean Greece, where the greatest researchers and psychoanalysts united to justify male-male love, where scientific institutes saw the light of day, supported by even the police who encouraged research into the reasons for the explosion of homosexual clubs, bars and hundreds of boy brothels. Students sought truth and the betterment of society through discussions taking place during hikes and encampments around fires, the participants underscoring their quest for freedom through male bonding and total nudism. Literature, poetry and naked boys filled magazines pinned open at kiosks to reveal the extraordinary beauty of the unclothed body. The last half of this book will be devoted to this liberating phenomenon. Thomas Mann wrote: &#x2018;&#x2019;I have lived and loved. I knew happiness, held in my arms he I longed for.&#x2019;&#x2019; To my mind this is the very aim of life. The only aim of life.

The novel&#x2019;s perspective ricochets among all members of the Melrose family -- the family featured in St. Aubyn&#x2019;s widely praised trilogy, <i>Some Hope</i> -- starting with Robert, who provides an exceptionally droll and convincing account of being born; to Patrick, a hilariously churlish husband who has been sexually abandoned by his wife in favor of his sons; to Mary, who&#x2019;s consumed by her children and overwhelming desire not to repeat the mistakes of her own mother. All the while, St. Aubyn examines the web of false promises that entangle this once illustrious family -- whose last vestige of wealth, an old house in the south of France -- is about to be donated by Patrick&#x2019;s mother to a New Age foundation. An up-to-the-minute dissection of the mores of child-rearing, marriage, adultery, and assisted suicide, <i>Mother&#x2019;s Milk</i> showcases St. Aubyn&#x2019;s luminous and acidic prose -- and his masterful ability to combine the most excruciating emotional pain with the driest comedy.</p><p>THE FOURTH PATRICK MELROSE NOVEL The once illustrious, once wealthy Melroses are in peril. Caught up in the wreckage of broken promises, child-rearing, adultery and assisted suicide, Patrick finds his wife Mary consumed by motherhood, his mother in thrall to a New Age foundation, and his young son Robert understanding far more than he should. But even as the family struggles against the pull of its ever-present past, a new generation brings a new tenderness, and the possibility of change.Mother&#39;s Milk was a 2005 New York Notable book and is a finalist for the 2006 Man Booker Prize.</p><h2>As a Man Thinketh</h2><p>&#34;Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes, And Man is Mind, and evermore he takes The tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills, Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills:- He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass: Environment is but his looking-glass.&#34; -from the &#34;Forward&#34; Literally a blueprint on living, this little gem serves as a course of action for approaching life in a meaningful manner.

After a rambunctious youth and series of short-lived jobs including door-to-door salesman, accountant, a peddler for a quack alcoholism cure and finally pencil sharpener wholesaler, Burroughs found his calling as writer. As the story goes, one of Burroughs&#39; duties was to verify the placement of advertisements for his sharpeners in various magazines. These were all-fiction pulp magazines, a prime source of escapist reading material for the expanding middle class. Burroughs spent time reading those magazines and decided he could write those stories just as well. He was lucky his first time out and sold Under the Moon of Mars. The Tarzan series followed this and Burroughs was now a full-fledged writer. Now, surrender yourself to Tarzan&#39;s exploits in the damp African Jungle, yield to the pull of primitive impulses as your imagination goes back again in prehistoric times, swinging from tree to tree in glorious abandon through the primeval forest or fighting the great cave bear with rude stone weapons. Tarzan and the Ant Men will hold you as spellbound as any of the previous stories.

The third time we walk up East Rongbuk Glacier will be the last, for better or worse. </blockquote><p> George Mallory wrote those words in May 1924, just days before he and Andrew "Sandy" Irvine made their final attempt to summit Mount Everest. They disappeared on June 8, 1924, and mystery has swirled around them ever since. Did they reach the summit, 29 years before Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary? </p><p> The recovery of Mallory's body in May 1999 provoked more questions than it answered. Clearly Mallory fell and then died of exposure. But was he on his way up or down? David Breashears (of IMAX <i>Everest</i> fame) and mountaineering historian Audrey Salkeld devote a thoughtful chapter to the discovery, examining the clues found with Mallory and speculating on his experiences on that fateful day. As is to be expected, however, Breashears and Salkeld leave it to others (including Conrad Anker and Jochen Hemmleb) to make conclusions; their book is about much more than Mallory's disappearance. <i>Last Climb</i> is an affectionate biography of Mallory, his fellow climbers, and their three Everest expeditions. Diaries and letters written by expedition members bring their voices into the present, while the authors' considerable Everest expertise ensures historical accuracy. Dozens of vintage photographs taken by Mallory and the other expedition members illustrate the text, revealing a time when "gentlemen mountaineers climbed in leather boots and tweeds"--their gear better suited to a bright day in the Scottish highlands than the slopes of Everest. </p><p> The morbid-minded may be disappointed that the only photograph of Mallory's remains is of his hobnailed boot, but others may see this as a mark of respect for the great climber. Beautifully presented and carefully written, <i>Last Climb</i> is easily the classiest book on the Mallory mystery. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>David Breashears,</b> an award-winning filmmaker and world-class mountaineer, has climbed to the summit of Mount Everest four times. In the spring of 1996, he was the expedition leader and co-director for the acclaimed IMAX� large-format film <i>Everest.</i> In 1983, he transmitted the first live pictures from the summit and directed and produced the documentary, <i>Everest: The Mystery of Mallory and Irvine.</i> He is the author of <i>High Exposure: An Enduring Passion for Everest</i> and <i>Unforgiving Places</i> and contributed photographs and an afterword to the National Geographic book <i>Everest: Mountain Without Mercy.</i> He lives in Boston.</p><h2>Unearthing Your Ten Talents</h2><p><p>Beginning with the Gospel parable of the talents which were buried in the ground by some, and multiplied by others Kevin Vost here unearths a treasure for those who are struggling to live a life of Christian virtue: the ten particular talents that God has given each of us as our own . . . to bury . . . or to multiply for our own good and the good of the Kingdom.</p> <p>Guided especially by St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the Church's greatest teachers, as well as by Fathers of the Church and the example of many saints, Vost explains how you can discover, understand, and perfect each of your own ten talents.</p> <p>In the process, you will develop your noble ability to reason, strengthen your faculties of mind, perfect your physical capacities for beauty of form and grace, nurture your ability to act angelically, and prepare yourself to live that life which is proper to a being made in the image of God.</p> <p>Do you know what your ten talents are? Do you know what God wants you to do with your life? As He gave ten talents to each of the souls in the parable, so He has given ten particular talents to you.

Marc Norman and renowned dramatist, Tom Stoppard have created the best screenplay of the year according to the Golden Globes and the New York Film Critics Circle.</p><p>Tom Stoppard has always had an ear for the Bard, stretching back to his surreal and hilarious early plays <i> Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i>, <i>Dogg's Hamlet</i>, and <i>Cahoots Macbeth</i>. For those who have already seen the film <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>, this screenplay offers a chance to savor Stoppard's exuberant collaboration with the renowned screenwriter Marc Norman. The result gives us, among many other things, a dog, Hamlet, Kit Marlowe, Elizabeth I, and probably one of the best screenplays in modern cinema based on Shakespeare. <p> The pace of the script, from its opening long shot of London in 1593 to the final shot of Viola walking off into her brave new world, is breathtaking. The verbal fireworks and Shakespearean borrowings are not only worthy of the Bard himself, but perfectly re-create the conditions of the Elizabethan theater. The jokes and allusions fly thick and fast, often straining the agility of even the most nimble Shakespeare scholar, but at the heart of the screenplay is both a compelling love story and an ingenious perspective on the inspiration behind both <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and <i>Twelfth Night</i>. A wonderful piece of writing--long may <i>Shakespeare in Love</i> keep the Bard in fashion! <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p></p><h2>Houses of the Founding Fathers</h2><p>When they declared independence in Philadelphia in 1776, they changed the course of Western history. But the patriots&#x2014;landowners, merchants, and professional men who hailed from towns, cities, and plantations scattered along the eastern seaboard&#x2014;had private lives too, quite apart from the public deeds we know so well. In this breathtaking volume, historian Hugh Howard and photographer Roger Straus examine the everyday lives of the Founding Fathers.&nbsp;<i>Houses of the Founding Fathers</i>&nbsp;takes us on an eye-opening tour of forty stately eighteenth-century houses. We see the mansions of such legendary figures as Jefferson, Washington, Adams, and Hamilton, along with the homes of many other signers of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution. At sites from Maine to Georgia, with stops in each of the thirteen colonies, the grand story of the Revolution emerges from unique and individual domestic perspectives.&nbsp;Houses overlooking the sea, in busy townscapes, or atop mountains reveal these patriots&#x2019; tastes in architecture, furniture, and horticulture. There are tales of friends and enemies, murderous relatives, reluctant revolutionaries, adoring wives, and runaway servants.

He is offered the chance to join a covert team chasing a prize whose value is limitless -- and whose dangers are endless. Here is a novel that takes mankind to the brink. A breakneck-paced crime thriller, ALTERED CARBON took its readers deep into the universe Morgan had so compellingly realised without ever letting them escape the onward rush of the plot. BROKEN ANGELS melds SF, the war novel and the spy thriller to take the reader below the surface of this future and lay bare the treacheries, betrayals and follies that leave man so ill-prepared for the legacy he has been given: the stars. This is SF at its dizzying best: superb, yet subtle, world-building; strong yet sensitive characterisation; awesome yet believable technology, thilling yet profound writing. Richard Morgan is set to join the genre&#39;s world-wide elite.</p><p>Critics have compared Richard Morgan's first novel, <i>Altered Carbon</i>, to the classic hardboiled fiction of Raymond Chandler. The comparison doesn't accurately describe Morgan's second novel, <i>Broken Angels</i>. Morgan's prose never approaches Chandler's metaphoric excess, and Morgan's antihero, Takeshi Kovacs, doesn't wisecrack nearly as often as Chandler's hero, Philip Marlowe. Also, Kovacs's far-future universe is considerably darker than Marlowe's noir world. In Kovacs's universe, high-tech implants called "stacks" record memory and personality; this means soldiers can be sent to their deaths, have their stacks implanted in new bodies, and be sent to their deaths again, and again, and again. Generals needn't quibble about wasting lives in massacres or nuclear explosions. The slaughtered soldiers will soon be back in action--unless their stacks aren't recovered. Then their consciousness will go mad, isolated in an indestructible, inescapable virtual reality. The proper term for the Takeshi Kovacs novels isn't "hardboiled." It's "brutal."<p> The Martians disappeared long ago, but they left behind their star gates, which have allowed humanity to spread across the galaxy--and bring warfare to the stars. As <i>Broken Angels</i> opens, Takeshi Kovacs is a lieutenant in humankind's most feared mercenary company, but rumors of an astonishing archaelogical discovery inspire his desertion. Humans have never found a Martian starship until, perhaps, now. If the rumors are true, and the ruthless Kovacs can take possession of the unprecedented relic, he will make his fortune. But if he fails in his quest, he may find himself imprisoned in high-tech hell for eternity. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>"Welcome back to the brash, brutal new world of the twenty-fifth century: where global politics isn't just for planet Earth anymore; and where death is just a break in the action, thanks to the techno-miracle that can preserve human consciousness and download it into one new body after another. <br>Cynical, quick-on-the-trigger Takeshi Kovacs, the ex-U.N. envoy turned private eye, has changed careers, and bodies, once more . . . trading sleuthing for soldiering as a warrior-for-hire, and helping a far-flung planet's government put down a bloody revolution. <br>But when it comes to taking sides, the only one Kovacs is ever really on is his own. So when a rogue pilot and a sleazy corporate fat cat offer him a lucrative role in a treacherous treasure hunt, he's only too happy to go AWOL with a band of resurrected soldiers of fortune. All that stands between them and the ancient alien spacecraft they mean to salvage are a massacred city bathed in deadly radiation, unleashed nanotechnolgy with a million ways to kill, and whatever surprises the highly advanced Martian race may have in store. But armed with his genetically engineered instincts, and his trusty twin Kalashnikovs, Takeshi is ready to take on anything--and let the devil take whoever's left behind.</p><h2>Frog and Toad are Friends</h2><p>Frog and Toad are Friends</p><p></p><h2>The Berenstain Bears&#39; Christmas Tree</h2><p>It's Christmastime in Bear Country, and Papa Bear is caught right in the middle of an ecological dilemma--every tree he picks to chop down is home to a fellow furred or feathered creature.

He is the author of <i>The Price of Experience</i>, <i>LAbyrinth</i>, <i>The Miracle Detective</i>, and <i>Untouchable</i>. He lives in Oregon.Sullivan (The Price of Experience) strikes again in the arena of California true crime, exploring the sordid world of big money, gangsta rap, guns and drugs. Opening with the shooting of a black man by a white man during a traffic incident, Sullivan underscores the not-so-well-known racial tempest brewing on the West Coast especially when he reveals that the shooter was an undercover narcotics investigator and the man killed was an off-duty L.A.P.D. officer who moonlighted for the disreputable Death Row Records. From here, Sullivan outlines the bad and the ugly of the music industry: mafioso-style music label management; the unsolved murders of rap superstars Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.; and a dizzying series of binary oppositions Crips vs. Bloods; West Coast rappers vs. East Coast rappers; Death Row Records' exec Suge Knight vs. Puffy Combs of Bad Boy Records, etc. Unfortunately, the basic material isn't exactly new; journalists Ronin Ro and Cathy Scott, among others, have previously covered the murders of Shakur and B.I.G. Still, Sullivan's reportorial writing style accurately reflects the investigative work of homicide gumshoe Russell Poole while building the drama within the truly labyrinthine political coverups, cop-to-criminal crossovers and the breaks in the L.A.P.D.'s code of silence.

This comprehensive monograph is the only detailed study of his remarkable career and includes a catalogue of his complete works from 1938 - 2000 spanning architecture and exhibition, interior and product design. An essay by Sergio Polano describes Castiglioni's important collaborations with his brothers Livio and Pier Giacomo and discusses his diverse range of projects including the spatial design work that dominated his early career as well as his later, better known product designs. Castiglioni's work is celebrated for its combination of technical innovation with an aesthetically-pleasing form, as demonstrated in his elegant Luminator floor lamp for Gilardi &amp; Barzaghi (1955) and the distinctive Frisbi hanging light for Flos (1978). His designs also demonstrated wit - the 'readymade' furniture designs created with Pier Giacomo in 1957 incorporated tractor and bicycle seats into new stools. He created hundreds of pieces of furniture, lighting and products for a distinguished client list including Kartell, Knoll, Zanotta, Alessi and Siemens. With more than 800 photographs and drawings, this monograph does full justice to his designs, which won eight prestigious Compasso d'Oro prizes.</p><p>After graduating in architecture in 1974, Sergio Polano taught architecture and contemporary art at several universities in Italy including the Iuav Venice, where he was Professor of History of Contemporary Art 1996-2008. He has written extensively on architecture, design and art and is the author of many books including monographs of Santiago Calatrava (1996) and Carlo Scarpa (1997).

But then the vivid, ominous dreams began in which Barasch saw his neck being probed, tortured, speared, and even removed. Convinced something was terribly wrong, he went to a doctor who eventually confirmed what Barasch's dreams had been telling him: he had thyroid cancer.<p> That's when Barasch's fascination with the power of dreams began. The result is a breakthrough book that calls upon 15 years of research as well as hundreds of real-life dreams to expertly explore this mysterious frontier. Readers can expect excellent, poetic prose (Barasch is the former editor in chief of <i>New Age Journal</i>) that speaks to the transformative powers within the bizarre, shape-shifting landscape of the dream world. He helps readers see when a dream reveals a personal calling, a warning from a diseased body, or an insight that can help dreamers overcome the wounds or beliefs that hold them back. Barasch reaches far beyond the typical dream analysis into the more ambitious realms of spiritual turning points, personal relationships, and mystical opportunities. For many readers this will be a life-altering book, one that forever shifts the dreamer's approach to dreams as well as the conscious world. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Marc Ian Barasch is the author of the awardwinning trilogy The Healing Path, Remarkable Recovery (with Caryle Hirshberg), and Healing Dreams.

Here he explicates the 10 <i>paramitas</i> ("perfections," or guides to conduct) of Mahayana Buddhism. Each discussion is followed by responses to his students' most-asked questions, addressing not only the topic at hand, but also the role of the teacher, the transformation of the self through sitting meditation (<i>zazen</i>), koan study, and the Mahayana tradition of responsibility for the welfare of others. Though known as a rigorous and traditional Zen master of both Rinzai and Soto lineages, Aitken calls the <i>paramitas</i> "inspirations, not fixed rules" and eschews perfectionism. This will be a good companion to <i>The Mind of Clover</i> (1984), Aitken's beautifully written exploration of Zen's Ten Grave Precepts (the uniquely Buddhist commandments). Both will appeal to those interested in Buddhist practice and ethics and, more broadly, to those who look to books for help with that perennial question: how to live.

But one group of birds - the corvids, or members of the crow family - appears to have powers of abstraction, memory, creativity, and insight that put them on a par with many mammals, including, in some instances, higher primates.<br>In an original and scrupulously researched text, Candace Savage describes the life and behavior of 16 representative species of corvids that are widely distributed throughout North America and Europe. Drawing on the most recent research, she suggests that the birds may apply their mental powers to such everyday activities as choosing mates, building nests, teaching their young, searching for food, and communicating with each other.<br>In the exciting collection of close-up images, drawn from the work of Erwin and Peggy Bauer, Fred Bruemmer, Tom and Pat Leeson, Leonard Rue III, Jeff Foott, and Antti Leinonen, among other photographers, the birds are often pictured in intimate moments, as they tend their nests, court their partners, assert their dominance, or challenge eagles and other large raptors.</p><p>back!

Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he&#x2019;s been emailing with, will be jeopardized.</p><p>With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon&#x2019;s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated.

This lovely, familiar view inspired her to write <i>Miss Emma's Wild Garden.</i> She lives in Milford, Pennsylvania. In Her Own Words...<p>"As a child I was very shy, but I enjoyed the attention I got from having my first-grade teacher put my drawings up on the wall. I remember sitting in my father's chair at the age of seven, looking at a Little Golden Book version of <i>Heidi</i> and telling my mother, "When I grow up, I want to make books for boys and girls." She said simply, "If that's what you want to do, that's what you should do."</p><p>"All the time I was growing up, first in rural Ohio, then, after my eleventh birthday, in Los Angeles, California, I read and drew. Sometimes I wrote, but I was shyer about that and usually tore it up. My parents and teachers encouraged me, but none of them could tell me much about how to go about "making books."</p><p>"In college my teachers told me that I had too much talent to waste on children's books, that "only Picasso gets away with drawing children," that I should "go have a baby and get it out of [my] system" and come back when I was ready to do " real art. " So at the end of my thirdyear, having taken all the basic art courses, a class in children's literature, and another in child care and management, I left school to study on my own.</p><p>"I checked out stacks of books from the library and read them to the preschoolers in the daycare center where I worked. I read books about writing and illustrating books for children, and experimented with printing techniques. I also started writing: poetry at first, then a few picturebook stories, timidly sharing them with friends. Although they encouraged me, I still didn't know how to go about submitting my work to a publishing company.</p><p>"I was twenty-eight years old before I got that information from a Society of Children's Book Writers' conference. By that time, having been married and divorced, I had two young daughters to support, and had earned my degree and teaching credentials from Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, California.</p><p>"During the next eight years I taught third grade, married a songwriting forest ranger named Gary Hines, had a third daughter, continued my writing and drawing, and collected over one hundred encouraging rejection letters from various publishing companies, eighteen of them from Susan Hirschman at Greenwillow Books.</p><p>"Then on Friday, November 13th, 1981, instead of sending me a nice rejection letter, Susan called to say, "We'd like to publish <i>Taste the Raindrops</i>." Since then my life has been full indeed, with a wonderful family and work I love.</p><p>"I am fascinated by children, by how they think, what they do each day, how they learn about the world around them, their relationships with others. I enjoy sorting it all out and making sense of it, especially as what is commonplace to us is new and engaging to them.</p><p>"Every once in a while I have the additional reward of hearing from a child, or parent of a child, for whom one of my books has meant something special. Then I'm really glad I didn't listen to my college teachers."</p>Kindergarten-Grade 2-- A book that's sure to be popular with those looking for a book to ease the introduction of a new sibling into the family. Whisper-soft pastel pencil drawings show the interactions between a newborn and her older brother throughout the baby's first year. The pictures are framed and labeled with the appropriate month. The backgrounds are kept simple to keep the emphasis on the two children. The story is told from the perspective of the older child as he relates, sometimes in verse, how he will show the little one everything: "I'll show you laps and taking naps." Hines keeps the vocabulary appropriately simple for a young child. As an illustrator, she has set herself the difficult task of showing the changing sizes and activities of a baby and young child month by month through the course of a year. The drawings are not static presentations, but show a range of movements from crawling to bouncing on Mom's knee. Some renderings are a bit off, but the whole is so enjoyable that they do not detract from the overall presentation. --Judith Gloyer, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rotherweird (Rotherweird, 1)</h2><p><b>"Baroque, Byzantine and beautiful--not to mention bold.

In 1922 he designed the first modern Catholic church building, St. Thomas the Apostle in Chicago, and in 1924 he traveled to Europe where he met Mies, Mendelsohn, Oud, and other modernist architects there. He was the only Prairie School architect to build in Europe, designing the concrete Church of Christ the King, built in 1928&#x2013;31 in Cork, Ireland. A dedicated modernist and progressive Catholic, Byrne concentrated for much of his career on Catholic churches and schools throughout North America, many of them now considered landmarks. &nbsp;This book charts the entire length of Byrne's work, highlighting its distinctive features while discussing the cultural conditions that kept Byrne in the shadows of his more famous contemporaries. Illustrated by more than one hundred photographs and drawings, this biography explores the interplay of influences and impulses--individualism and communalism, modernism and tradition, pragmatism and faith--enduring throughout Byrne's life and work.<br></p><p>One of Frank Lloyd Wright's earliest apprentices, a visionary of modern Catholic church buildings<br>Vincent L.

The Arts and Crafts landscape aesthetic is interpreted for today&#39;s gardeners, allowing them to incorporate the simplicity and harmony that distinguishes the style into their own outdoor spaces. The book details specific ways readers can bring Arts and Crafts elements to their homes and gardens, such as including pergolas that effectively link house and garden or by planting native species that add a compelling sense of place.</p><p>Anyone who is interested in the art of gardening and the form, texture, and shape of plants (and what gardener isn't?) will enjoy this book just for the sheer beauty of its photography. The dramatic design, with flowing masses of herbaceous plantings playing off Arts &amp; Crafts structures (birdbaths, sundials, and arbors), is captured in numerous full-page color photographs. The Arts &amp; Crafts ideal of the unity of house and garden shows in the interplay of plants and garden structures: roses climbing old stone walls, rows of fluffy lavender shaded by the heavy crosspieces of pergolas, branching tree limbs captured in stained glass.<p> The skill of the craftsperson and the gardener in unifying house and garden shines through in the details of the stone and woodwork and the lushness of the planting. These design ideas, developed in the mid-18th century in reaction to a perceived threat of mechanization, are as aesthetically pleasing today as they were 150 years ago. And the juxtaposition of the sturdy, hand-hewn quality of the craftsmanship with the free-flowing plantings is no doubt needed even more today in our world of faxes, computers, and cell phones.</p><p> Reading Rick Darke's love poem of a book to Arts &amp; Crafts gardens is like going on a tour of North America and Britain's best gardens, accompanied by a most knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide. You are invited into the back gardens of all those really cool bungalows; your stroll through the gardens is enhanced by informed discourse on their history and the techniques used to create them. Many of the design ideas translate well to today's smaller gardens: dividing space into garden "rooms," and using urns or fountains as focal points and screens to create a sense of enclosure within the garden. Darke, an ornamental grass expert from Pennsylvania, has written the definitive--and the most beautiful--book on Arts &amp; Crafts gardens. <i>--Valerie Easton</i></p>My work has afforded me the opportunity to visit and photograph a great many Arts &amp; Crafts gardens in Great Britain and across North America. I've been lucky to wake up in many of these gardens, to share meals and conversation in them. My journeys have left an indelible mark on my own understanding of the garden and how richly it can contribute to the character of daily life. This book is a distillation of these lessons learned from the Arts &amp; Crafts garden.</p><h2>China Hand: An Autobiography (Haney Foundation Series)</h2><p><p>Winner of the 2012 Douglas Dillon Award of the American Academy of Diplomacy</p><p>At the height of the McCarthyite hysteria of the 1950s, John Paton Davies, Jr., was summoned to the State Department one morning and fired. His offense? The career diplomat had counseled the U.S. government during World War II that the Communist forces in China were poised to take over the country&#x2014;which they did, in 1949. Davies joined the thousands of others who became the victims of a political maelstrom that engulfed the country and deprived the United States of the wisdom and guidance of an entire generation of East Asian diplomats and scholars.</p><p>The son of American missionaries, Davies was born in China at the turn of the twentieth century. Educated in the United States, he joined the ranks of the newly formed Foreign Service in the 1930s and returned to China, where he would remain until nearly the end of World War II. During that time he became one of the first Americans to meet and talk with the young revolutionary known as Mao Zedong. He documented the personal excesses and political foibles of Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. As a political aide to General Joseph "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell, the wartime commander of the Allied forces in East and South Asia, he traveled widely in the region, meeting with colonial India's Nehru and Gandhi to gauge whether their animosity to British rule would translate into support for Japan. Davies ended the war serving in Moscow with George F. Kennan, the architect of America's policy toward the Soviet Union. Kennan found in Davies a lifelong friend and colleague. Neither, however, was immune to the virulent anticommunism of the immediate postwar years.</p><p><em>China Hand</em> is the story of a man who captured with wry and judicious insight the times in which he lived, both as observer and as actor.</p></p><p>John Paton Davies, Jr. (1908-99) was a Foreign Service officer in the U.S. Department of State from 1931 to 1954. He was also the author of Foreign and Other Affairs and Dragon by the Tail: American, British, Japanese, and Russian Encounters with China and One Another. Todd S.

As history and biography, <i>China Hand</i> is first rate."&#x2014;Dan Rather</p><br><br><p><i>China Hand</i> is low-key but forceful, at times quite deliciously witty. . . . No doubt <i>China Hand</i> will be of particular interest to students of Chinese history from the 1930s to the 50s and of American diplomacy during the same period, but its greatest value is as the personal testament of a man who was the wholly innocent victim of political opportunism yet retained his sense of personal worth and, equally important, his undying loyalty to the country that had served him so poorly. His life should be an object lesson to everyone.&#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><br><br><p>""[This] globetrotting memoir is rich in intrigue, candid, credible, and masterfully told."&#x2014;Andrew Burstein, <i>The Advocate</i></p><br><br><p>"An often funny, always insightful account of an adventurous and wonderful life.

The mechanized and armored units and their equipment are a particular feature of the book. The photographs are a valuable visual record of the tanks, guns, jeeps and trucks &#x2013; the most up-to-date military vehicles and weaponry of the time &#x2013; as they moved along the roads and through the towns and countryside of southern France.</p><p>Anthony Tucker-Jones is a former defense intelligence officer and a widely published expert on regional conflicts, counter-terrorism and armsred and aerial warfare.

Thanks to Nathaniel Tripp's extraordinary depiction of war in Vietnam, based on his own experiences, I finally understand what it was like to fight there. Here is the savagery, the terrible anxiety, the sheer unreality of the conflict, and above all the appalling innocence and unpreparedness of the young Americans who were sent into that incomprehensible war. <p> Skillfully interwoven with the war story is how the author comes to terms with his own terror, with his failed father and their failed relationship, and how he makes up for the lost love of a parent by becoming something like a father to the men in his platoon. I can't recommend <b>Father, Soldier, Son</b> highly enough.</p>""Father, Soldier, Son will stand as one of the finest soldier memoirs of the Vietnam War . . . If all that has been written about the war in Vietnam, in fiction and nonfiction, has made it a familiar story to some, Tripp overcomes cliche by individualizing every well-known fact." -- "The Boston Globe <br>NATHANIEL TRIPP GREW UP fatherless in a house full of women and he arrived in Vietnam as a just-promoted second lieutenant in the summer of 1968 with no memory of a man's example to guide and sustain him. The father missing from Tripp's life had gone off to war as well, in the Navy in World War II, but the terrors were too much for him, he disgraced himself, and after the war ended he could not bring himself to return to his wife and young son. In "some of the best prose this side of Tim O'Brien or Tobias Wolff" ("Military History Quarterly), Tripp tells of how he learned as a platoon leader to become something of a father to the men in his care, how he came to understand the strange trajectory of his own mentally unbalanced father's life, and how the lessons he learned under fire helped him in the raising of his own sons.<br>"Not since Michael Herr's Dispatches has there been anything quite as vivid, gripping and soul-searing," raved the "Washington Post, and the "Chicago Tribune said "the description of combat in the jungles of Vietnam are authentic and terrifying, as good as any I have read in fact or fiction."</p><h2>Agony and the Ecstasy</h2><p>Irving Stone&#39;s powerful and passionate biographical novel of Michelangelo.

It was late and dark, yet the storm clouds zipping from one end of the sky to the other still held within them a curious pink-red hue. Between the time lapse&#x2013;like passage of the clouds and the deathly still tundra plain (where the wind has no trees to shake or leaves to scatter), I felt as if I were entering some disturbing, unworldly, goat-headed netherworld.</p><p>&#x201c;This place is just weird,&#x201d; said Liam, a cook in the passenger&#x2019;s seat, looking up at the clouds.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking the same thing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Deadhorse houses about three thousand oil-field laborers who live at the work camp for a month at a time before they fly back to wherever&#x2019;s home for a week or two. In Deadhorse, there are no churches, schools, families or anything that would make it resemble a normal American town. It is a cold, lifeless, cheerless (and nearly femaleless) place where nobody in his right mind would ever want to live&#x2014;an assertion that would insult no one, as it is held most ardently by those who call themselves permanent residents.</p><p>I pulled into the Deadhorse Camp parking lot and carefully stepped out into fifty-mile-per-hour winds, placing my feet into the mud-gravel ground with all of my weight for fear that my handful of linens and I would capsize with the next heavy gust.</p><p>How I found myself in Deadhorse is worth a story of its own, but suffice it to say, I was desperate and needed money. I&#x2019;d moved up to Alaska with the intention of turning a series of blog essays (from my web site, regrettably named The Spartan Student) into a book about a few years of my life during which I lived in a van so that I could afford grad school. But after a series of disappointments, I had to set my sights on the much more practical task of eking out a living.</p><p>Deadhorse Camp is a steely rectangular Halliburton housing unit that runs entirely on diesel fuel. I worked alongside four coworkers all my age, cooking and cleaning for about fifty oil-field workers who stayed at our camp. Oddly enough, three of us had college degrees in English&#x2014;a degree that clearly did nothing to prepare us for the duties of succeeding in the professional world but did, however, empower us to have impassioned forty-five-minute conversations about whether the film Scream does or does not fit within the horror genre.</p><p>I was given one side of a red-and-white outdoor Travco trailer that was outfitted with giant skis so it could be dragged over the ice in winter. The manager encouragingly referred to it as my &#x201c;writing studio,&#x201d; but the desk, which had been glued to the wall decades before, fell off the moment I placed my laptop on it.</p><p>Coworkers shared the communal shower with the tourists and pipeline workers. Because, as we were told, water cost thirty-five cents a gallon, it was no surprise that the water flowed from the shower nozzle at an exasperating dribble. The water pressure being so slight, I had to stand directly beneath it. Whenever I turned to wash a different part of my body, I&#x2019;d accidentally nudge the hot-cold dial, which was hyper sensitive, so much so that a millimeter adjustment to the left or right would send either a boiling, skin-melting trickle onto my shoulders or a polar, heart-stopping slush.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t mind my accommodations at all. In fact, I was plenty amused with the novelty of the camp and its eccentric drabness, but the work&#x2014;the work!&#x2014;was depressing. I&#x2019;d come into the kitchen at six p.m. (the &#x201c;dish shift&#x201d;) and scrub the bottoms of burned soup pots, dip my hand into sink drains to pluck out handfuls of slippery vegetables, and cram heavy black industrial trash bags into polar bear&#x2013;proof dumpsters. I&#x2019;d set up the salad bar, slice the bread, arrange the dessert rack, fold used cardboard, and clean up the kitchen for the morning cook. There once was a time when I was a student, a park ranger, an adventurer. And now look at me. Dishwasher.</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds like your inner Odysseus is lost at sea,&#x201d; said Liam, Deadhorse&#x2019;s thirty-year-old prize chef. I&#x2019;d just let out a sigh for the third time in an hour while trying to use a wire brush to scrub dried specks of mashed potato off the rim of a large metal stirring bowl.</p><p>Oh, Liam. How I liked Liam! Every evening we&#x2019;d work alongside each other. He&#x2019;d cook, I&#x2019;d clean, and we&#x2019;d talk. Our conversations were the only thing I looked forward to. Liam was a few years older than I was. He was extremely well-read and the sort of person who knows all the names of Homer&#x2019;s Greek characters and who could apply his erudition to everyday issues, like the way he assigned some of the few female Deadhorse oil-field laborers with personality-revealing names such as &#x201c;Circe&#x201d; and &#x201c;Calypso.&#x201d; Liam was one of those rare people you come across in life who you want to stuff into a sack and carry with you wherever you go.</p><p>My Deadhorse stay was supposed to last only a couple of weeks, but it would turn into a couple of months. Over the course of the summer, I&#x2019;d gone from the glorified title of writer-in-residence, to tour guide, to dishwasher, as if I were on some cruel, Scrooge-like, time-traveling tour, visiting my jobs of yesteryear, each demanding less skill and responsibility than the last.</p><p>I cursed more. I told crass, tasteless jokes. I wore smelly, stained, soup-splattered shirts. I spent my nights drinking Pabst and watching TV series after TV series, and the beginnings of a paunch steadily strained the elastic in my black kitchen pants. I knew things were going from pathetic to thinking, Maybe Cymbalta is right for me? when I dropped a tray of turkey lunch meat onto the floor, and instead of cursing, I just stared at the meat sprawled across the linoleum in deadly silence.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to get out,&#x201d; Liam said. &#x201c;We need to see the ocean.&#x201d;</p><p>Our plan was to walk five miles to the Sagavanirktok (or Sag) River and paddle north three miles to the Arctic Ocean in lightweight inflatable kayaks called packrafts. We&#x2019;d then paddle west for a few miles along the coast before heading back to Deadhorse, where we needed to be back in time for our kitchen shifts the next morning.</p><p>We put on dry suits, strapped light backpacks around our shoulders, and hiked out over the flat, firm, easy-on-the-feet tundra. The fall foliage was colored with squash yellows, apple reds, and pumpkin oranges. Most of the birds had migrated south, but there were vestiges of summer swarms of flying life: snowy owls, loons, floating gulls, flocks of geese, and a clatter of ravens. Off to the north&#x2014;through Liam&#x2019;s binoculars&#x2014;we saw a golden eagle on the ground flapping its wings at a ghost-white arctic fox that was obnoxiously running laps around it.</p><p>We inflated the packrafts and let the Sag&#x2014;swift and powerful at these northern latitudes&#x2014;carry us to the Arctic Ocean. The ocean, though, wasn&#x2019;t a mere couple of miles away as Liam thought it was. Behind every bend in the river, we expected to see the chilly gray expanse of the ocean, but the river continued to meander northward with no end in sight.</p><p>Our leisurely paddle downriver was brought to a halt when we caught sight of something big and white and round. Liam and I pulled over to the bank instinctively.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you see that?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>He took out his binoculars.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what it is, but it&#x2019;s big and it&#x2019;s moving,&#x201d; Liam said nervously.</p><p>We were unarmed except for a canister of bear spray, and we had no strategy for dealing with a polar bear except to (1) Wait for it to get within twenty feet so we could drizzle it with a puff of cayenne or (2) Drop everything and hopelessly scamper across the empty tundra, which, with each passing second, appeared to be the far more sensible option.</p><p>I frantically deflated my raft and sloppily strapped it to the outside of my pack with frozen hands covered in wet sand. The polar bear continued its swim toward us, my heart leaping every time I looked up and saw that it was getting closer. It was only a matter of seconds before we would have to drop everything and enthusiastically commit to our coldly Darwinian &#x201c;whoever&#x2019;s fastest wins&#x201d; option number two, but the bear turned out to be nothing more than a drifting seagull leisurely floating down the Sag. (One&#x2019;s depth perception, we learned, cannot be trusted on this flat, lunar, North Slope landscape.)<br>Okay, no polar bear, thank God, but we had other problems to deal with. For one, because of the rushed, slapdash nature of our adventure, we didn&#x2019;t think to bring any sleeping bags or tents. And because we were so far north and well past the northern tree line, there was no wood to start a fire. And after looking at my GPS, I saw that we had a twelve-mile hike back to Deadhorse, which would actually be more like fifteen when you factor in all the ponds, lakes, and tundra bogs we&#x2019;d have to walk around. And our biggest problem: we would have to walk through the vigilantly monitored, hyper-secure Prudhoe Bay oil field&#x2014;the largest oil field in North America that, before drilling started in 1977, held twenty-five billion barrels of oil. Hiking through the oil field is strictly prohibited, and while we had no desire to break the law, there was no way we could get around Prudhoe Bay. We&#x2019;d have to sneak through. We&#x2019;d have to trespass.</p><p>We had walked a mile southwest, or what we thought was southwest, and when I looked down and picked up my pack that I&#x2019;d set down a moment before, I wasn&#x2019;t sure which direction we&#x2019;d come from and which direction we were supposed to head. I did a 360. And then another 360. I was spinning.</p><p>The land around us was perfectly flat. The sky was an overcast gray. Everything, up and down, left and right, looked exactly the same. I frantically spun and spun and spun, seeking a hill, a distant building, or a blotch of sunshine behind the clouds that might bring some sense to this senselessly unvarying plains landscape. But there was nothing. I pulled out my GPS, and it gave a different directional reading each time I looked at it. Twisting in circles, my compass seemed to be just as disoriented as I was. The plains, which I&#x2019;d thought to be the epitome of monotony and tranquility, turned out to be as mysterious and menacing as the core of a smoldering volcano.</p><p>Sit down, Ken, I told myself. Calm down.</p><p>But in addition to panic, I felt something else: the jolt of a raw encounter with an unforgiving wilderness, the exuberance of having a firsthand experience with the world, a wild gush of emotions that made me feel, though scared and panicky, overflowing with life.</p><p>I sat down and made myself eat a sandwich. My compass needle ceased its spinning, and I was finally able to locate the bland southwesterly direction we needed to head toward.</p><p>Hours passed. Night replaced day and a frosty mist clung to my facial hair. On the edge of a lake in front of us stood a giant bull caribou bearing a curled crown of antlers that were orbited by two batlike short-eared owls, both of which&#x2014;after the caribou had regally trotted off and disappeared into the fog&#x2014;came to inspect us, hovering silently above our heads like kites.</p><p>The distant horizon was speckled with the lights of oil camps and roadway lamps. In front of us was one such oil camp, a small metallic facility with about a dozen outdoor lights. We were all whispers now, wary of being caught and having to deal with the possibility of an interrogation, a fine for trespassing, or something worse. It was close to midnight, so we thought we could slip by undetected. As we neared the building, we saw some humanlike movement. A spotlight clicked on. Whoever was manning the light drew figure eights onto the tundra until he trained the spotlight directly on us.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re screwed,&#x201d; I whispered. </p><p>&#x201c;Just stay still,&#x201d; Liam said. &#x201c;If they come near, just lie on the ground.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? I don&#x2019;t know, man. Maybe it would be better if we just gave in if they&#x2019;ve already caught us.&#x201d;</p><p>I was equal parts disturbed by and admiring of Liam&#x2019;s composure. How was he not nervous? We stood still for minutes&#x2014;two mannequins frozen in midstride whispering out of the corners of our mouths&#x2014;until we decided that the guy with the spotlight was probably too far away to see us. We started hiking again, lengthening our strides and adding an alarmed briskness to our gaits. We reached an industrial road and placed our footsteps in sync with each other&#x2019;s to reduce the volume of our boots&#x2019; crunch over the gravel. We ducked under a pipeline and continued on.</p><p>There were lights everywhere in all directions. White lights, orange lights, red lights, blinking lights, the lights of trucks prowling from facility to facility. They knew we were out there. Because of the depth perception problem, we couldn&#x2019;t tell which lights were close and which were far away. The buzz of machines was everywhere: beeps, honks, and whirring engines that had us swiveling our heads every few moments.</p><p>Looking over the facilities, I thought that there was something disturbing about this place, this barren coastal plain. I&#x2019;d felt it ever since I&#x2019;d come up here and more so now that I was walking through the oil fields. The place made me think of the film Black Narcissus, set in the Himalayas in an old palace that a few well-meaning nuns were trying in vain to transform into a school. The wind from the mountains drove the nuns mad. It never stopped. It moved into their rooms, invading, molesting, reminding them, like a ghost, that this place is and always will be a place of kings and queens, jewels and perfumes, self-indulgence and debauchery, and that you can either accept that or die trying to change it.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how I felt about Deadhorse. That we shouldn&#x2019;t be there. That this place was meant to be still and silent, unbothered and undeveloped. The giant drills, the mud-spattered trucks, the rusty oil barrels, the big diesel-run complex. It bore a special brand of ugliness&#x2014;the ugliness of a place existing in complete disharmony with its surroundings. The oil was finite and Deadhorse was temporary. We&#x2019;ll make a mess of the area for a few decades then leave the corrugated mess to the cold and wind forever after. And we are not real inhabitants&#x2014;just suckerfish along for the ride, desperately clinging to the belly of the great oil-filled beast.</p><p>The Inuit, who once lived along these shores, built homes from the earth, kayaks from skins, clothes from fur. They lived and died here for thousands of years, leaving not the slightest blemish on the land. Surely they didn&#x2019;t view the coastal plain the way the oilman does. Here, the Inuit&#x2019;s eye was probably drawn to caribou browsing ami...</p></p><h2>Henri Cartier-Bresson: A Biography</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Will inspire fans and followers to rediscover its elusive subject&#x2019;s remarkable oeuvre.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p> The twentieth century was that of the image, and the legendary photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, born in 1908, was the eye of the century. Cartier-Bresson was always on the spot, recording historic events as they happened. His work focused on Mexico in the 1930s, the tragic fate of the Spanish Republicans, the liberation of Paris, the weariness of Gandhi a few hours before his assassination, and the victory of the Chinese Communists. It was he who fixed forever in our minds the features of famous contemporaries: Giacometti, Sartre, Faulkner, Camus, and others, their portraits captured for eternity at the decisive moment. An intensely private individual, Cartier-Bresson nonetheless took Pierre Assouline into his confidence over a number of years, discussing his youthful devotion to surrealism, his lifelong passion for drawing, his experience of war and the prison camps, his friends, and the women in his life. He even opened up his invaluable archives. 25 illustrations</p><p>Pierre Assouline, a writer and journalist, has written biographies of Georges Simenon, Herg�, and others. He lives in Paris.Often called the father of photojournalism, Cartier-Bresson tried to give up photography as a profession four times in his life, returning to his first love, painting, repeatedly&#x2014;but he always kept his Leica in his pocket. The Frenchman captured the emotion and magnitude of some of the 20th century's most significant news stories by simply turning his camera away from the main event and into the crowd. This, too, is Assouline's approach to biography. Drawing on five years of conversations with his subject, Assouline presents not a chronological or critical accounting of events but a portrait, illustrated through descriptions of Cartier-Bresson's photographs (almost none of which are reproduced in the book) and summarized with generalizations of the artist's approach toward art and life: "His taste was classical: he needed that kind of order to counter the vulgarity of the world outside" or "In affairs of the heart, he was a seductive romantic." Energetic and informative passages describe Cartier-Bresson's years as a soldier and his travels to the Ivory Coast, China and India (where he photographed Gandhi just hours before his death). Despite its gaps&#x2014;such as mere passing references to Cartier-Bresson's two marriages&#x2014;this smooth hagiography will inspire fans and followers to rediscover its elusive subject's remarkable oeuvre. <i>(Nov. 28)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the epic poets of antiquity to contemporary writers of science fiction, from the authors of the Holy Scriptures to modern raconteurs of fairy tales, writers and storytellers through the ages have invented imaginary and mythical lands, projecting onto them all of our human dreams, ideals, and fears. In the tradition of his acclaimed History of Beauty, On Ugliness, and The Infinity of Lists, renowned writer and cultural critic Umberto Eco leads us on a beautifully illustrated journey through these lands of myth and invention, showing us their inhabitants, the passions that rule them, their heroes and antagonists, and, above all, the importance they hold for us. He explores this human urge to create such places, the utopias and dystopias where our imagination can confront things that are too incredible or challenging for our limited real world. Illuminated with more than 300 color images, The Book of Legendary Lands is both erudite and thoroughly enjoyable, bringing together disparate elements of our shared literary legacy in a way only Umberto Eco can.

Despite their distinct cultural identities, these regions share common culinary points: generous use of olive oil; lots of fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts; fish at least twice a week; moderate dairy and poultry; very little red meat; and, happily, wine with meals. In return, Mediterranean-area dwellers are trimmer than their American counterparts and live longer, healthier lives. It's a commonly cited connection, and Seaver, associate publisher of Arcade and a frequent visitor to the Mediterranean, says this isn't "a diet book" on the phenomenon. Rather, she offers a cookbook emphasizing "the gourmet rather than the mundane" of the Mediterranean culinary landscape: ingredients should be seasonal and fresh, and meals are meant to be enjoyed at leisure. Classics like gazpacho, bouillabaisse and moussaka appear alongside lesser-known regional dishes like Terrine of Monkfish with Green Sauce, and Pork Loin in Dried Figs Sauce. Some recipes are as simple as Fresh Vegetables with Anchovy Cream, while others, such as Quenelles of Pike or Shrimp, boost the difficulty level, but are explained in enough detail to make them doable. Seaver has created a mouth-watering tribute to a healthy, scrumptious cuisine. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sentence after perfect sentence it grips and does not let go.&#34; (Donal Ryan). &#34;A violent, superbly lyrical western offering a sweeping vision of America in the making [and] the most fascinating line-by-line first person narration I&#39;ve come across in years.&#34; (Kazuo Ishiguro). &#34;I am thinking of the days without end of my life...&#34; After signing up for the US army in the 1850s, aged barely seventeen, Thomas McNulty and his brother-in-arms, John Cole, go on to fight in the Indian wars and, ultimately, the Civil War. Having fled terrible hardships they find these days to be vivid and filled with wonder, despite the horrors they both see and are complicit in. Their lives are further enriched and imperilled when a young Indian girl crosses their path, and the possibility of lasting happiness emerges, if only they can survive. Moving from the plains of the West to Tennessee, Sebastian Barry&#39;s latest work is a masterpiece of atmosphere and language. Both an intensely poignant story of two men and the lives they are dealt, and a fresh look at some of the most fateful years in America&#39;s past, Days Without End is a novel never to be forgotten.</p><p>Sebastian Barry was born in Dublin in 1955. His novels and plays have won the Costa Book of the Year award, the Kerry Group Irish Fiction Prize, the Irish Book Awards Novel of the Year, the Independent Booksellers Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. He also had two consecutive novels, A Long Long Way (2005) and the top ten bestseller The Secret Scripture (2008), shortlisted for the MAN Booker Prize. He lives in Wicklow with his wife and three children.Chapter One<br><br> The method of laying out a corpse in Missouri sure took the proverbial cake. Like decking out our poor lost troopers for marriage rather than death. All their uniforms brushed down with lamp-oil into a state never seen when they were alive. Their faces clean shaved, as if the embalmer sure didn&#x2019;t like no whiskers showing. No one that knew him could have recognised Trooper Watchorn because those famous Dundrearies was gone. Anyway Death likes to make a stranger of your face. True enough their boxes weren&#x2019;t but cheap wood but that was not the point. You lift one of those boxes and the body makes a big sag in it. Wood cut so thin at the mill it was more a wafer than a plank. But dead boys don&#x2019;t mind things like that. The point was, we were glad to see them so well turned out, considering.<br><br> I am talking now about the finale of my first engagement in the business of war. 1851 it was most likely. Since the bloom was gone off me, I had volunteered&nbsp; aged seventeen in Missouri. If you had all your limbs they took you. If you were a one-eyed boy they might take you too even so. The only pay worse than the worst pay in America was army pay. And they fed you queer stuff till&nbsp;your shit just stank. But you were glad to get work because if you didn&#x2019;t work for the few dollars in America you hungered, I had learned that lesson. Well, I was sick of hungering.<br><br>Believe me when I say there is a certain type of man loves soldiering, no matter how mean the pay. First thing, you got a horse. He might be a spavined nag, he might be plagued by colic, he might show a goitre in his neck the size of a globe, but he was a horse. Second place, you got a uniform. It might have certain shortcomings in the stitching department, but it was a uniform. Blue as a bluebottle&#x2019;s hide.<br><br> Swear to God, army was a good life. I was seventeen or there- abouts beginning, I could not say for certain. I will not say the years going up to my army days was easy. But all that dancing put muscle on me, in a wiry sort of way. I&#x2019;m not speaking against my customers, I&#x2019;m speaking for them. If you pay a dollar for a dance you like a good few sweeps of the floor for that, God knows.<br><br> Yes, the army took me, I&#x2019;m proud to say. Thank God John Cole was my first friend in America and so in the army too and the last friend for that matter. He was with me nearly all through this exceeding surprising Yankee sort of life which was good going in every way. No more than a boy like me but even at six- teen years old he looked like a man right enough. I first saw him when he was fourteen or so, very different. That&#x2019;s what the saloon owner said too. Time&#x2019;s up, fellas, you ain&#x2019;t kids no more, he says. Dark face, black eyes, Indian eyes they called them that time. Glittering. Older fellas in the platoon said Indians were just evil boys, blank-faced evil boys fit to kill you soon as look at you. Said Indians were to be cleared off the face of the earth, most like that would be the best policy. Soldiers like to talk high. That&#x2019;s how courage is made most like, said John Cole, being an understanding man.<br><br> John Cole and me we came to the volunteering point together of course. We was offering ourselves in a joint sale I guess and the same look of the arse out of his trousers that I had he had too. Like twins. Well when we finished up at the saloon we didn&#x2019;t leave in no dresses. We must have looked like beggar boys. He was born in New England where the strength died out of his father&#x2019;s earth. John Cole was only twelve when he lit out a-wandering. First moment I saw him I thought, there&#x2019;s a pal. That&#x2019;s what it was. Thought he was a dandy-looking sort of boy. Pinched though he was in the face by hunger. Met him under a hedge in goddamn Missouri. We was only under the hedge as a consequence the heavens were open in a downpour. Way out on those mudflats beyond old St Louis. Expect to see a sheltering duck sooner than a human. Heavens open. I scarper for cover and suddenly he&#x2019;s there. Might have never seen him otherwise. Friend for a whole life. Strange and fateful encounter you could say. Lucky. But first thing he draws a little sharp knife he carried made of a broken spike. He was intending to stick it in me if I looked to go vicious against him. He was a very kept-back-looking thirteen years old I reckon. Anyhows under the hedge aforementioned when we got to talking he said his great-grandma was a Indian whose people were run out of the east long since. Over in Indian country now. He had never met them. Don&#x2019;t know why he told me that so soon only I was very friendly and<br> maybe he thought he would lose that blast of friendship if I didn&#x2019;t know the bad things quickly. Well. I told him how best to look at that. Me, the child of poor Sligonians blighted likewise. No, us McNultys didn&#x2019;t got much to crow about.<br><br> Maybe out of respect for the vulnerable soul of John Cole I might skip ahead violently and avoid an account of our earlier years. Except he might also acknowledge that those years were important in their way and I cannot say either that they constituted in any way a time of shameful suffering in particular. Were they shameful? I don&#x2019;t see eye to eye with that. Let me call them our dancing days. Why the hell not. After all we was only children obliged to survive in a dangerous terrain. And survive we did and as you see I have lived to tell the tale. Having made our acquaintance under an anonymous hedge it seemed natural and easy to join together in the enterprise of continuing survival. That is John Cole in his minority and I placed our steps side by side on the rainy road and proceeded into the next town in that frontier district where there were hundreds of rough miners working and a half dozen tumultuous saloons set up in a muddy thoroughfare endeavouring to entertain them.<br><br> Not that we knew much of that. In these times John Cole was a slight boy as I have laboured to illustrate with his river-black eyes and his lean face as sharp as a hunting dog. I was my younger self. That is though I was maybe fifteen after my Irish and Canadian and American adventures I looked as young as him. But I had no idea what I looked like. Children may feel epic and large to theyselves and yet be only scraps to view.<br><br> Just sick of stumbling round. Two is better together, he said.<br><br> So then our idea was to find work slopping out or any of the jobs abhorrent to decent folk. We didn&#x2019;t know much about adult persons. We just didn&#x2019;t know hardly a thing. We were willing to do anything and even exulted in the fact. We were ready to go down into sewers and shovel the shit along. We might have been happy to commit obscure murders, if it didn&#x2019;t involve capture and punishment, we didn&#x2019;t know. We were two wood-shavings of humanity in a rough world. We were of the opinion our share of food was there if we sought it out. The bread of heaven John Cole called it because after the fall of his father he has much frequented those places where hymns and meagre food was put into him in equal measure.<br><br> Weren&#x2019;t many places like that in Daggsville. Weren&#x2019;t any. Daggsville was all uproar, mucky horses, banging doors, queer shouting. By this time in my biographical ventures I must con- fess I was wearing an old wheat-sack, tied at the waist. It sorta looked like clothing but not much. John Cole was better in an old queer black suit that musta been three hundred years old, judging by the gaps in it. Anyway he was having a breezy time of it about the crotch, far as I could see. You could nearly reach in and measure his manhood, so your eyes did their best to be kept looking away. I devised a good method to deal with such a thing and fixed fiercely on his face, which was no work in itself, it was a pleasing face. Next thing comes up in our view a spanking new building all fresh wood and even a last sparkle in the recently beaten nailheads. Saloon a sign said, no more nor less. And underneath, on a smaller sign hanging from a string,&nbsp;Clean boys wanted.<br><br> Look, see, says John Cole, who didn&#x2019;t have the great learning I had, but had a little none the less. Well, he says, by my mother&#x2019;s loving heart, we do fulfil half of that requirement.<br> Straight in, and there was a highly pleasant quotient of good dark wood, dark panelling floor to ceiling, a long bar as sleek and black as an oil-seep. Then we felt like bugs in a girl&#x2019;s bonnet. Alien. Pictures of those fine American scenes of grandeur that are more comfortable to gaze on than to be in. Man there behind the bar, complete with chamois cloth, philosophically polishing a surface that needed no polishing. It was plain to see all was a new enterprise. There was a carpenter finishing up on the stairs going to the upward rooms, fitting the last section of a rail. The bartender had his eyes closed or he might have seen us sooner. Might even have given us the bum&#x2019;s rush. Then the eyes open and instead of the drawing back and cussing at us we ex- pected this more discerning individual smiled, looked pleased to see us.<br><br> You looking for clean boys? says John Cole, a tincture pugilistic right enough, still prophesying menaces.<br><br> You are right welcome, the man says. We are? said John Cole.<br><br> You are. You are just the thing, especially the smaller one there, he says. <br><br>That was me he was meaning. Then, as if he feared John Cole might take offence and stamp out away &#x2013; But you&#x2019;ll do too, he says. I&#x2019;m giving fifty cents a night, fifty cents a night each, and all you can drink, if you drink easy, and you can bunk down in the stable behind us, yes indeed, cosy and comfortable and warm as cats. That&#x2019;s if you give satisfaction.<br><br> And what&#x2019;s the work? says John, suspicious. <br><br>Easiest work in the world, he says.<br><br>Such as?<br><br> Why, dancing, dancing is all it is. Just dancing.<br><br> We ain&#x2019;t no dancers far as I know, says John, flummoxed now, violently disappointed.<br><br> You don&#x2019;t need to be dancers as such in the accepted dictionary definition of the word, says the man. It&#x2019;s not high-kicking anyhow.<br><br> Alright, says John, lost now just from a sense aspect &#x2013; but, we ain&#x2019;t got no clothes to be dancing in, that&#x2019;s for sure, he said, displaying his very particular condition.<br><br> Why, all&#x2019;s supplied, all&#x2019;s supplied, he says.<br><br> The carpenter had paused in his work and was sitting on the steps now, smiling big.<br><br> Come with me, gentlemen, says the bartender, likely the owner too, with his swank, and I will show you your clothing of work.<br><br> Then he strode over his spanking new floor in his noisy boots, and opened the door into his office. It had a sign on it said Office so we knew. Why, boys, after you, he said, holding the door. I got my manners. And I hope you got your manners, because even rough miners love manners, yes indeed.<br><br> So we troop in, all eyes. There&#x2019;s a rack of clothes like a gaggle of hanged women. Because it&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s clothes. Dresses. There was nothing else there, and we looked around thoroughly, we did.<br><br> Dancing starts eight sharp, he says. Pick something that fits.&nbsp;Fifty cents, each. And any tips you get is yours to keep.<br><br> But, mister, says John Cole, like he was talking to a pitiful insane person. We ain&#x2019;t no women. Can&#x2019;t you see. I is a boy and so is Thomas here.<br><br> No, you ain&#x2019;t women, I can see. I could verify that second you came in. You fine young boys. Sign says looking for boys. I would gladly sign up women but ain&#x2019;t no women in Daggs- ville but the storeman&#x2019;s wife and the stableman&#x2019;s little daughter. Otherwise it&#x2019;s all men here. But men without women can get to pining. It&#x2019;s a sort of sadness gets into their hearts. I aim to get it out and make a few bucks in the process, yes, sir, the great American way. They need only the illusion, only the illusion of the gentler sex. You&#x2019;re it, if you take this employment. It&#x2019;s just the dancing. No kissing, cuddling, feeling, or fumbling. Why, just the nicest, the most genteel dancing. You won&#x2019;t hardly credit how nice, how gentle a rough miner dances. Make you cry to see it. You sure is pretty enough in your way, if you don&#x2019;t mind me saying, especially the smaller one. But you&#x2019;ll do too, you&#x2019;ll do too, he says, seeing John Cole&#x2019;s newly acquired pro- fessional pride coming up again. Then he cocks an eyebrow, interrogatory like.<br><br> John Cole looks at me. I didn&#x2019;t care. Better than starving in a wheat-sack.<br><br> Alright, he says.<br><br> Gonna put a bath for you in the stable. Gonna give you soap. Gonna supply the underwears, muy importante. Brought with me from St Louis. You&#x2019;ll fill them fine, boys, I reckon&nbsp; you&#x2019;ll fill them fine, and after a few glasses no man I know will object. A new era in the history of Daggsville. When the lonesome men got girls to dance with. And all in a comely fashion, in a comely fashion.<br> And so we trooped out again, shrugging our shoulders, as if to say, it was a mad world, but a lucky one too, now and then. Fifty cents, each. How many times, in how many bowers before sleep in our army days, out on the prairie, in lonesome decliv- ities, we liked to repeat that, John and me, over and over, and never failing in our laughter, Fifty cents &#x2013; each.<br><br> That particular night in the lost history of the world Mr Titus Noone, for that was his name, helped us into our dresses with a sort of manly discretion. Give him his due, he seemed to know about buttons and ribbons and such. He had even had the fore- sight to sprinkle us with perfumes. This was the cleanest I had been in three years, maybe ever. I had not been noted in Ireland for my cleanliness truth be told, poor farmers don&#x2019;t see baths. When there is no food to eat the first thing that goes is even a flimsy grasp of hygiene.<br><br> The saloon filled quickly. Posters had been speedily put up around town, and the miners had answered the call. Me and John Cole sat on two chairs against a wall. Very girl-like, well behaved, sedate, and nice. We never even looked at the miners, we stared straight ahead. We hadn&#x2019;t ever seen too many sedate girls but a inspiration got into us. I had a yellow wig of hair and John had a red one. We musta looked like the flag of some country from the neck up, sitting there. Mr Noone had thoughtfully filled out our bodices with cotton. Okay but our feet were bare, he said he had forgotten shoes in St Louis. They might be a later addition. He said to mind where the miners stepped, we said we would. Funny how as soon as we hove into those dresses everything changed. I never felt so contented in my life. All miseries and worries fled away. I was a new man now, a new girl. I was freed, like those slaves were freed in the coming war. I was ready for anything. I felt dainty, strong, and perfected. That&#x2019;s the truth. I don&#x2019;t know how it took John Cole, he never said. You had to love John Cole for what he chose never to say. He said plenty of the useful stuff. But he never speaked against that line of work, even when it went bad for us, no. We were the first girls in Daggsville and we weren&#x2019;t the worst.<br><br> Every citizen knows that miners are all sorts of souls. They come into a country, I seen it a thousand times, and strip away all the beauty, and then there is black filth in the rivers and the trees just seem to wither back like affronted maids. They like rough food, rough whisky, rough nights, and truth to tell, if you is a Indian gi...</p><h2>The Coral Sea</h2><p>A collection of lyrical writings provides a tribute to the author&#39;s enduring friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe and describes the late artist&#39;s coming of age, relationship with Sam Wagstaff, and battle with AIDS.</p><p>Patti Smith is a poet, performer, visual artist, and author of the National Book Award-winning memoir Just Kids.

What the FED hailed as The Great Moderation has left the middle class to take on a lifetime of bank debt to obtain access to housing, education to get a job, an auto to drive to it, and simply to maintain living standards that wages and salaries no longer support. What has derailed the economy is the take-over of academic economics and politics by the financial sector in order to censor criticism and misrepresent statistics so as to give the impression that the economy can borrow its way out of debt. The reality is that income used to pay down today s debt overhead is not available to be spent on goods and services. The result is debt deflation, followed by austerity and the the &#34;fire sale&#34; or decay of infrastructure at the national and local levels. The most controversial claim by Prof. Hudson is that Debts</p><p></p><h2>Jesus Symbol of God</h2><p>Already hailed as a landmark in contemporary Catholic theology, Jesus Symbol of God surveys scriptural data, the key moments in the development of doctrine, and the distinctive horizons of our contemporary world to develop a comprehensive and systematic christology for our time.

It traces three distinct design traditions the Native American center place with kiva and terraced residential blocks, the Hispanic plaza with church and courtyard houses, and the Anglo square with courthouse and business blocks. This landmark volume has resulted from a multi-year research project involving 50 students, a half dozen faculty members, and outside experts working through the Historic Preservation and Regionalism program at the University of New Mexico School of Architecture and Planning. New Mexico's plazas, like urban spaces everywhere, are gaining renewed attention in this time when the challenges of sustainability have sparked the Smart Growth movement, urban revitalization and intensified historic preservation. Detailing the success of restoration projects, this book shows how to encourage heritage tourism in the service of, rather than at the expense of, local quality of life and community sustainability.</p><p></p><h2>Gravity Falls Happy Summerween! / The Convenience Store . . . of Horrors!</h2><p>It&#39;s Summerween in Gravity Falls!

They couldn't have seen me. I'm fairly sure they couldn't have seen me. And so what if they had? It's not like I was doing anything wrong. It's perfectly natural, isn't it? Like the way motorists slow down to get a view of an accident. Probably the police would have assumed it odd if I hadn't been watching. I mean, I couldn't tell from where I was standing, but I bet the rest of our neighbors were all watching, too. All with their lights off. All cloaked discreetly by their curtains. What I didn't like was the impression I had that everyone out there was also looking discreetly at me. That the police being out there, at that time of night, was all just a show. A reminder.<br><br> God, this is hard. Harder than I thought it would be. It's knowing where to begin as much as anything. I'm not Syd. I know what she thinks, what conclusions she's drawn already, but I don't process things the way she does. If she had gone first, I don't know where we would have ended up, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have had a clue about where to go next.<br><br> I guess for me the only logical place to start is the day we first saw the house. This was back in April. It's September now. The fourteenth. At 3:17 in the morning, to be precise. Syd's in bed, but I couldn't sleep even if I wanted to. I doubt she's sleeping either, to be honest. I don't think she's slept properly in weeks. Me, I drop off easily enough. Every night I don't think I'm going to, but it's exhaustion, I suppose, the weight of worry. Tonight, though, our decision made, I just wanted to get on with it.<br><br> There's a lot to get through and not a lot of time.<br><br> The open house day, then. I suppose it has to be, though there�s very little about the day itself that was unusual. I recall how busy it was, how many people, when the time came, narrow-shouldered their way through the front door. Because there was a queue, you see. Not a line, but one of those messy, I-was-here-first scrums you see at bus stops. We�d arrived forty minutes early and already there were half a dozen couples ahead of us.<br><br> But that wasn't uncommon. Not for a house viewing in London. The strange thing was that it wasn't just the house that was up for sale. Whoever bought it would also be buying everything the house contained. And once Syd and I had got inside, we saw that the entire place was stuffed with junk. Actual dragged-home-from-the-dump junk. Books, too, and clothes, coats, pictures on every square inch of wall, boxes stacked heedless of shape or size, plus furniture big and small in every crevice. It was like a live-in, life-and-death version of Jenga.<br><br> Oh, and birds. Clearly the current owner was into dead stuff. Taxidermy-doing it, hoarding it, I couldn't tell. There was a hawk, a seagull, even a pigeon amid the scattered flock. Syd must have noticed them, too. I remember being surprised that she didn't turn around the moment she did see them and walk straight out.<br><br> The story the estate agent gave us was that the owner had met a woman on the Internet. She lived in Australia, apparently, and he'd dropped everything to run off and be with her. Just like that. He'd been approaching retirement age anyway, but even so he chucked in his job, abandoned his friends and signed over his house-dead pets and all-to the estate agent to sell as one bumper package. Which made a good sales pitch, I suppose, and accounted for the state of the place-but personally, right from the off, I just couldn't see it. I mean, what sort of person would do that? And-setting the storybook explanation aside for a moment-why?<br><br> So, yes, that was odd, and for me more than a bit off-putting. Maybe it wouldn't have bothered me so much if I'd fallen for the house itself. I mean, the layout wasn't a problem, and there was more than enough space (living room, kitchen, separate dining room, plus one, two, three bedrooms-not including the unconverted attic). The building, though-it was creepy. There's no other word to describe it. The garden was overgrown and the paintwork about as attractive as a skin complaint. The house stood alone ("detached," marveled the brochure) as though it had been shunned. There was a row of terraced houses on one side, huddled together as though for safety, and a block of flats with its back turned on the other. It looked-and felt-somehow ostracized.<br><br> So I suppose all I'm saying is I didn't like the place. All that junk, the building itself-it just felt wrong. The problem I had was that Syd was clearly smitten. I knew she would be. She knew she would be; it was Syd who'd found the house on the Internet and who'd insisted we arrive at least half an hour early.<br><br> "So-oo," I remember her saying to me, once we'd finally finished looking around. "What do you think?"<br><br> We were in the living room, beside the fireplace. I remember this older guy kept staring at me from across the room. I was conspicuous in trainers and a T-shirt, whereas all the other blokes my age wore a collar, pressed jeans and polished brogues. They were City types, basically, or-like the man who kept staring-fathers of spoiled little rich kids. And probably that was the other thing that was stopping me sharing Syd's enthusiasm. It had taken Syd and me more than two years to scrimp enough for a deposit, whereas most of the couples we were up against had likely earned theirs from a single bonus. So on that playing field, with London rules-how could the two of us be expected to compete?<br><br> "I think it's like The Hunger Games," I answered uncomfortably. What I meant was that bit in the film before the action starts, where the contestants are drifting around, pretending to be friends-to be allies or whatever-when really they're just itching to kill the crap out of one another.<br><br> Syd looked at me blankly. I knew for a fact she'd seen the movie at the cinema, but her memory about stuff like that isn't the greatest. She smoked a lot when she was younger, and I'm not talking Marlboro Lights. She did a lot of drugs, actually. I'm not saying I've never dabbled myself, but there're certain people they affect more than others. Syd had a difficult upbringing. Horrendous, actually-so bad that she's still never told me the whole story. And when, later on, she had her troubles, the drugs, I reckon, played a part. She says they didn't. She says all the damage had already been done. But weed, coke, pills, what have you-that stuff definitely leaves a mark.<br><br> "Just . . . all these people," I explained. "I mean, I knew there'd be other interest, but nothing like this."<br><br> Syd slipped her hands around my waist. "Forget about everyone else for a moment. What do you think about the house?"<br><br> I paused for half a second too long. "I like it," I said at last. "I do."<br><br> "But?"<br><br> "But . . . nothing. It's just . . . it's kind of dark, that's all."<br><br> I think Syd assumed I was merely playing my role, in house-hunting as well as in life. Syd dishes out her affection as though she's sharing Skittles, whereas I trail stoically beside her, kicking tires and knuckle-tapping walls. It's rare that I know what I'm wary about exactly (What's actually supposed to happen when you kick a tire, other than the reverberation in your toes?), but it's a part I've somehow settled into. It's what men do, I've learned from somewhere. My father, probably, who could suck the joy out of riding on a rollercoaster. Plus, as I say, Syd definitely needs a counterweight. It's why we're so good together. She stops me gazing at my feet so much; I stop her floating off into the sky.<br><br> "That's just the weather," Syd countered. "All these people. Plus, have you seen all of this stuff?"<br><br> I was half expecting her then to mention those birds. She didn't.<br><br> "There's an attic, too," I said. "If the rest of the place is like this, what must it be like up there?"<br><br> Syd glanced toward the ceiling. I joined her, worrying in that moment whether the whole building was liable to suddenly cave in.<br><br> "Well," said Syd, "we'll just have to hire a van or something. A man. Assuming we can still afford it."<br><br> She smiled then and tucked a stray strand of hair behind a perfectly formed ear. In the house in which I grew up there was this blossom tree outside my bedroom window. Cherry, apple, I've no idea. It flowered pink but never actually bore any fruit. The leaves, though, were this deep, rosewood brown, which came aglow when caught by the light. Syd's hair, which she never dyes, is exactly the same color.<br><br> "Jack? I'm not going to make you live somewhere you don't want to. If you really don't like it, then let's just leave."<br><br> It wasn't a guilt trip. Syd truly meant what she'd said. So maybe I should have said something. Maybe I could have put an end to it all then and there.<br><br> We did leave . . . but in the end we put in an offer as well. Just for the hell of it. And, I'll admit, because Syd was clearly head over heels and I wanted her to be happy. Besides, what harm could it do? I didn't love the place, but I didn't hate it exactly-and anyway we couldn't afford it. The mortgage we had agreed wouldn't even get us to the asking price, and the details stipulated offers over. So there was no way we'd get it, not given the level of interest. All those people, with all their money . . .<br><br> I felt safe because we shouldn't have had a chance.<br><br> Chapter two<br><br> Sydney<br><br> Jesus Christ. I knew this would be a bad idea. I fucking knew it.<br><br> First off, this isn't a ghost story. OK? Let's make that very fucking clear. The house stood alone as though shunned. Who do you think you are, Jack-Stephen King? Creepy house, creepy furnishings, a happy(ish) couple moving in all dumb and cheerful. All the elements are there. If this really were a Stephen King novel, there'd be cats turning into zombies by chapter three.<br><br> But I say again, this isn't a ghost story. It's . . . I don't know what this is. That's why I'm writing it. That's why we are. Right, Jack? Isn't that what we agreed?<br><br> I know what he's trying to do. He wants you to think that we're just spooked, that we've imagined the whole entire thing. Or that I have. (The drugs, Jack? Really?) But the clues. The reminders or whatever you want to call them. I have them right here in my desk drawer. And this thing on the surface in front of me. Looking at me. Staring at me. I don't want to, but if I chose to I could reach out and touch it. It's real. Like the blood; that was real too. Remember the blood, Jack? How I wished we'd both of us imagined that!<br><br> He's in denial, that's what it is. He's trying to act like none of this is happening. Part of Jack's problem is he can't stand the idea of people thinking badly of him. He gets all hot and sweaty if someone tells him off for putting his feet up on the train. So this . . . what this looks like . . . he can't handle it. Not that I'm handling it either but at least I'm acknowledging it's happening. Because it's like a horror story, I'll admit. I've seen things out of the corner of my eye and imagined things I know weren't really there. But that . . . it's just . . . it's part of it. You see that, Jack, don't you? Surely you must fucking see that!<br><br> I'm so angry right now I don't know if there's any point in my going on. I mean, if buying the house was my idea, then writing this was most definitely Jack's. I let him talk me into it but only because it was better than doing nothing. That's what I thought, anyway. Now? Now I'm not so sure.<br><br> Oh, and just for your information, Jack, of course I dye my fucking hair.<br><br> And Skittles. Skittles.<br><br> I need a cigarette. I need a cigarette and I don't even smoke!<br><br> So I�ve been for a walk.<br><br> Around the common, I was about to type, but in reality to the newsagent's for a ten-pack of Marlboros. Reds. I smoked two in a row standing on the corner-a shooter of nicotine and traffic fumes. There's nothing like a breath of fresh air to calm the nerves, don't you find?<br><br> I don't usually swear like that, I promise. I swear, more than most people my age (more than most paratroopers, probably), but not, what? Let me count. Four f-bombs in just the first few paragraphs. It's just . . . I'm nervous. I'm freaking out, in fact. Soon enough you'll understand why.<br><br> But what I've decided is, maybe I'm overreacting. To what Jack wrote, I mean, not to what's been happening to us. In those circumstances I think I've been pretty fucking calm. (OK, that's it, I promise. No more swear words for the rest of this entry. Breathe, Sydney. Think yoga.)<br><br> My first reaction was, this isn't a confessional. How dare you talk so glibly about my past? How dare you be so bloody judgmental? (Is bloody a swear word? My rule's going to be, if I've heard it on EastEnders it doesn't count.) Like the drugs: there're certain people they affect more than others. What Jack means is, how could you have been so stupid, Syd? After everything that happened to you, how could you have allowed yourself to fall into that trap? What Jack doesn't understand-what I'm not sure he's ever understood-is how desperate I was to feel something other than what I felt. For a way out. Any way out. When you're caught inside a dungeon, even the faintest flicker in the dark is like a promise of daylight. And if it turns out not to be, if it turns out instead to be a burning staircase . . . Well, you take your chances anyway.</p><h2>Majorelle: A Moroccan Oasis (Small Books of Great Gardens)</h2><p>The Majorelle Gardens of Marrakech were laid out in the 1920s by Louis Majorelle, the French decorator, architect and painter renowned for his participation in both the art nouveau and art deco movements. He gave his name to the shade of blue lavishly used to paint the house and ornament the garden decoration. The site has been restored and replanted by the designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Berge in the vibrant primary colours of the original, to which they have added their personal touch. This manual explores the Gardens through photographs and text, and includes garden maps, plant lists and practical information on visiting times and best seasons.</p><p>These four exquisite books launch a new series profiling famous gardens, including the Islamic water gardens of Spain's Alhambra; Ninfa, a romantic garden laid out in the ruins of a medieval village 45 miles southeast of Rome; the tropical Moroccan gardens of Majorelle, laid out in the 1920s by French artist Louis Majorelle and now owned by Yves St. Laurent and partner Berg?; and the fairy-tale setting of Apremont, in which a towered castle rises over a flower-filled medieval village on the bank of the Allier River. Each of these little books (6" x 9") relates the history of the region and garden spot and the construction of the garden and includes over 100 color photographs, many double- page spreads. The stunning photography is by noted garden photographer de Virieu, the texts by individuals who know and love the featured garden. All the gardens are open to the public, and each book contains visitor information and garden layouts. Despite a few flaws (the small print in the captions is difficult to read, and Alhambra had a messy word-processing mix-up that wasn't caught), these breathtakingly lovely books make a wonderful introduction for anyone who plans to visit these gardens. Highly recommended for garden or travel collections.ACarol Cubberley, Univ. of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice: My Life with Carlos Castaneda</h2><p>Amy Wallace's memoir of her complex relationship with Carlos Castaneda plunges readers deep into the reality of the Castaneda cult and the psychological terrors it perpetrated. With the skill of a master storyteller, Wallace recounts early meetings with Castaneda, shares previously unpublished material straight from the Nagual, and explores the aftermath of Castaneda's death and the long term effects of his legacy. Insightful and unwaveringly honest, <i>Sorcerer's Apprentice</i> is simultaneously a love story, a cautionary tale about the dangers of giving one's power to another, and a joyous account of healing and self-affirmation.</p><p>"Amy Wallace takes you behind the scenes into the bizarre personal and sexual life of one of the most influential yet elusive figures of the 60s and beyond&#x2014;Carlos Castaneda. This book is her journey with the man and his inner circle from her unique vantage point as one of his lovers and wives. Her idealism and disillusionment mirror that of an era which left many, like Amy, searching for hope and unwilling to descend into cynicism and bitterness. Amy&#x2019;s struggle to rebuild a new foundation, though a story of seduction and betrayal on many levels, is also about the author&#x2019;s reaching for transformation and personal meaning. This book will greatly interest anyone who was ever affected by &#x2018;the teachings of don Juan.&#x2019; " <br>&#x2014;Joel Kramer &amp; Diana Alstad, co-authors of The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power <p> "Carlos Castaneda told astonishing truths, with an empowering Gnostic brilliance. He also told astonishing lies, spinning out like wild silk from a crazy spider&#x2019;s ass. Sorcerer&#x2019;s Apprentice tells the horrifying, heartbreaking tale of the lives entangled in his web. And it hurts like a son of a bitch. With far greater personal honesty than Castaneda ever managed, Amy Wallace drags us&#x2014;first happily, then screamingly&#x2014;deep into the Cult of Carlos: boldly capturing both the staggering beauty and the utter steaming nonsense of his world. It&#x2019;s an ass-kicking, soul-grinding book, beautifully written and breathtakingly acute. I suggest that you read it, and test your faith." <br>&#x2014;John Skipp, novelist, filmmaker </p><p>"Amy Wallace has gone through the looking glass of Castaneda&#x2019;s magic and come back out the other side with her wits, and wit, intact. What&#x2019;s more, she has remembered it all with a novelist&#x2019;s eye and ear, so the result is a harrowing and vivid look at life inside a charismatic circle&#x2014;the petty tyrannies, the abusive cruelties, the sometimes unintended silliness. If this remarkable book is evidence, what enabled her to survive Castaneda and his cult is a lucid, generous, often funny intelligence that spares no one, least of all herself." <br>&#x2014;Joe Kanon, author of Los Alamos </p><p>"Amy Wallace expertly maps the territory where mysticism merges into insanity, or perhaps the unmarked land between screwball comedy and terrifying tragedy. I can&#x2019;t recall a stranger, sadder narrative than this." <br>&#x2014;Carolyn See, author of Making a Literary Life </p><p>"Amy Wallace&#x2019;s compelling memoir reveals what some of us suspected all along: Don Juan&#x2019;s teachings are a yucky way of knowledge." <br>&#x2014;Jon Winokur, author of The Portable Curmudgeon </p><p>"Carlos Castaneda was one of the shapers of human consciousness during the period between the Beatles and the end of the twentieth century. After his death he remains a major spiritual and intellectual force. Yet he cast a schizophrenic shadow over our civilization. On the one hand, he taught us that we are here for a brief time in a beautiful, wondrous manifestation, and we must throw off the shackles of materialism, academic reductionism, and commercial distraction to realize our destiny, to experience the vast, untapped potential of our body-minds; on the other hand, he made the task so daunting and ultimately (if one reads him literally) terrifying and hopeless that he paralyzed many of his devotees and readers into inaction, submission, addictions, and denial. Amy Wallace has finally come along to liberate us from the spell. She says, &#x2018;I will show you Carlos as he was. Follow the authentic spirit guide in him, but reject the manipulations of a tragically flawed and jealous guru. You are free to meet the Eagle on your own terms.&#x2019; " <br>&#x2014;Richard Grossinger, author of Planet Medicine </p><p>"I read Sorcerer&#x2019;s Apprentice with absolute fascination. Like millions of others, I had always wondered what was behind the Castaneda myth. My own life once gave me the choice of going down the guru path, a choice I rejected because, to me, it&#x2019;s morally wrong for one person to claim closer knowledge of deity than any other. It&#x2019;s always a lie, and the fearsome consequences of that lie in the life of the unfortunate creature who takes the guru path, as well as his followers, is exposed here with breathtaking candor. Sorcerer&#x2019;s Apprentice is an extremely powerful book and fair warning both to those who would presume to claim special favor in the spirit, as well as those drawn by their own needs to such people. Amy Wallace warns us with her honesty and her careful attention to crucial emotional details, that guru-worship is a disease. For those who have wondered whether or not Castaneda&#x2019;s various guides were real in some objective sense, reading this book will clear up the mysteries that need solving. But it is also a compassionate book, deeply so, because compassion inevitably flows from honesty of this high an order. It is a triumph of Amy Wallace&#x2019;s heart to have written this, and I thank her for the wisdom and enrichment of spirit that reading it has given me." <br>&#x2014;Whitley Strieber, author of Communion</p>Amy Wallace has published twelve books, including <i>The Psychic Healing Book </i>with Bill Henkin, and with her family co-authored the #1<i> New York Times </i>bestselling <i>Book of Lists</i> series, which sold millions of copies worldwide.

Now this superb writer captures the timeless essence of generosity and goodwill in a magical collection of Christmas stories that showcase her remarkable talent while taking us on breathless journeys to fascinating realms filled with wonder and joy.<br><br>This enchanting group of eight tales--two of which are original to this collection--begins with the title story, "Miracle," in which an office worker hopes that her handsome colleague will finally notice her at the company Christmas party. But her carefully devised plans go awry when her guardian angel takes it upon himself to show her the true meaning of love. In the cautionary tale "In Coppelius's Toyshop," the motto What Goes Around Comes Around serves as an eerie reminder to a jaded narcissist who finds himself trapped in a crowded toy store at Christmastime.<br><br>In the touching "Adaptation," the Ghosts of Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come pay a visit to a lonely bookstore clerk, who discovers that the best gift of all is to give--even when his one wish for the holidays doesn't come true. "Inn" presents the inspiring story of a choir singer who gives shelter on a cold winter night to a homeless man and his pregnant wife--only to learn later that there's much more to the couple than meets the eye. And "Epiphany" follows three unwitting, modern-day wisemen on a quest unlike any they've ever experienced.<br><br>A treasure to cherish anytime of the year, this collection boldly reimagines the stories of Christmas and serves as a testament to Connie Willis's unique genius and skill in bringing the extraordinary to life while conveying the power of human compassion and love.</p><p>Connie Willis <i>loves</i> Christmas. "I even like the parts most people hate--shopping in crowded malls and reading Christmas newsletters and seeing relatives and standing in baggage check-in lines at the airport. Okay, I lied. Nobody likes standing in baggage check-in lines," she writes. Willis knows it's <i>hard</i> to write good Christmas stories: the subject matter is limited, the writer has to balance between sentiment and skepticism, and too many fall into the Victorian habit of killing off saintly children and poor people. Here she presents eight marvelous Christmas tales, two of which appear for the first time.<p> The stories range from "The Pony," about a psychotherapist who doesn't believe that Christmas gifts can answer our deepest longings, and "Inn," in which a choir member rehearsing for the Christmas pageant becomes part of the original Christmas story, to "Newsletter," where an invasion of parasitic creatures causes unusually good behavior in their hosts, and "Epiphany," a story of three unlikely Magi following signs through a North American winter toward the returned Jesus Christ. "Miracle" is a comic romance echoing Willis's favorite Yuletide movie, <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>, and "Catspaw" is a homage to the traditional Christmas murder mystery with a sly, science-fictional twist. The collection also includes "In Coppelius' Toyshop," in which a bad guy is trapped in Toyland, and "Adaptation," a Dickensian story about what it means to keep Christmas in your heart.</p><p> Those who want only SF stories may find this collection lacking, but anyone who enjoys complex tales with true Christmas spirit will treasure it. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><b>Praise for the work of Connie Willis:</b><br><br><b>To Say Nothing of the Dog</b>, winner of the Hugo Award:<br><br>"The most hilarious book of its kind since John Irving's <b>The Water-Method Man</b> and <b>A Confederacy of Dunces</b> by John Kennedy Toole...Willis' sure-handed plotting, unforgettable characters, and top-notch writing should garner quite a few award nominations."<br>--<i>Des Moines Sunday Register</i><br><br>"Few writers can match Willis' blend of comedy and science fiction. <b>To Say Nothing of the Dog</b> finds her in her top form."<br>--<i>San Francisco Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle</i><br><br><b>Doomsday Book</b>, winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards:<br><br>"A tour de force."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Splendid work--brutal, gripping, and genuinely harrowing, the product of diligent research, fine writing, and well-honed instincts, that should appeal far beyond the usual science-fiction constituency."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br><b>Lincoln's Dreams</b>:<br><br>"A love story on more than one level, and Ms. Willis does justice to them all.

From James A. Michener to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, from Amy Tan to Hanif Kureishi, Faith: Stories investigates the boundaries of faith and ritual in everyday life. In one story, a one-eyed Chinese child learns that all heavens are not the same. In another, a wealthy moneylender finds a relic of the Prophet Muhammad and decides to keep it instead of returning it to its shrine. In a third, a father whose son begins to blindly preach the Koran becomes engaged in a fanaticism of his own.<br> With subtlety and surprise, wit and candor, these stories explore issues of faith such as sacrifice, superstition, myth, and disbelief. Together they form an illuminating prism of the religious experience in today's world.</p><p>C. Micheal Curtis, senior editor of The Atlantic Monthly, has edited three anthologies: American Stories: Fiction from The Atlantic Monthly, Contempory New England Short Stories, and Contemporary California Short Stories. He lives in Massachusetts.Introduction<br><br>This book began to take shape almost immediately after the publication of <br>God: Stories, its partner-in-reflection. Several stories in the present volume <br>could not be included in the earlier book, both because I ran out of room and <br>because they seemed, somehow, not to fit. Once God: Stories was <br>published, and reviewers began to tell me what I had failed to consider in <br>putting it together, I began to realize that I had missed a number of mind-<br>broadening possibilities. In choosing stories rooted in Protestant, Catholic, <br>and Jewish traditions, I had unwittingly excluded more than half of the world"s <br>believers.<br> Faith: Stories, at least in part, is an attempt to close this gap. <br>And while such an attempt to be inclusive necessarily exposes the <br>limitations of the exercise, this book attempts an encounter with spiritual <br>traditions unremarked in its predecessor. I"ve included two stories&#x2014;sections <br>of novels, as it happens&#x2014;that touch on matters fundamental to Quaker <br>traditions and lore; other stories concern Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and <br>Confucian values and ideas. While none of these stories intend or <br>accomplish a full appreciation of the traditions from which they arise, they do <br>underline instructive truths about the strength and transformative power of <br>diverse faith experiences.<br> Faith, of course, occurs in many forms, and with various <br>consequences. We tell ourselves we need to believe in something beyond <br>our own basic wish for survival and comfort, and readers should not be <br>surprised to find here a scattering of stories about the stare-down between <br>rationalism and steadfast faith in sacred agency. Hanif Kureishi"s "My Son <br>the Fanatic" and Salman Rushdie"s "The Prophet"s Hair" are examples. The <br>same might be said of Khushwant Singh"s "The Mark of Vishnu" or Marjorie <br>Kemper"s remarkable "God"s Goodness." In some stories faith is disorienting, <br>even crippling, while in others it provides a gentle and unexpected respite <br>from the hard realities of lives taken over by pain and disappointment.<br> God: Stories was intended, among other things, as a resource for <br>reading and assessment by church groups like the one at the West Concord <br>Union Church, in Concord, Massachusetts, where many of its stories were <br>discussed well before they reappeared in book form. Faith: Stories will, I <br>hope, extend that exercise, and its broader range ought to invite a <br>conversation about ways in which faith commitments both divide and <br>strengthen us.<br><br>C.

Next&#x2014;and this is the important bit&#x2014;you must imagine yourself inside it. Inside the sky, floating beside me. Below us, the green and blue disc of the earth.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now focus. 17� 59' 0" North, 76� 44' 0" West. Down there is the Caribbean, though not the bits you might have seen in a pretty little brochure. We are beyond the aquamarine waters, with their slow manatees and graceful sea turtles, and beyond the beaches littered with sweet almonds. We have gone inland. Down there is a dismal little valley on a dismal little island. Notice the hills, how one of them carries on its face a scar&#x2014;a section where bulldozers and tractors have sunk their rusty talons into its cheeks, scraped away the brush and the trees and left behind a white crater of marl. The eyesore can be seen from ten or more miles away. To the people who live in this valley, it feels as if they wear the scar on their own skin&#x2014;as if a kind of ruin has befallen them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Seen from up here, the ramshackle valley looks like a pot of cornmeal porridge, rusting tin roofs stirred into its hot, bubbling vortex. Perhaps it is the dust bowls, the tracts of sand and the dry riverbed that give the place this cornmeally look. The streets run in unplanned and sometimes maze-like directions; paved roads often thin into dirt paths; wide streets narrow into alleys lined with zinc or scrap-board fences. If solid concrete houses rise like sentinels at the beginning of a road, the architecture will devolve into clumsy board shacks by the time you get to the cul-de-sac. If on one road the houses are separated into tidy lots, on the road just over they are crowded together and lean into each other as if for comfort. This is a community that does not quite come together. <br>&nbsp;<br>We must imagine there was a time when all of this was beautiful and unscarred; a time when the hills were whole and green&#x2014;verdant humps rolling up towards the Blue Mountain range above; a time when the valley was thick with guava trees, when wild parakeets flew above the forest and fat iguanas sunbathed on river-smoothed rocks. But that is all we can do. Imagine. There is no forest any more, and no more iguanas, and the mineral river that once flowed swiftly through the valley is now dammed up, its waters diverted to the city&#x2019;s reservoir. Where there was once a perfect green hill, there is now a scar, and where there was once a river, there is now just a dry riverbed, little boys playing football among its vast sands. Where there once was beauty, now there is just &#x201c;Augustown,&#x201d; or sometimes &#x201c;Greater Augustown&#x201d; if you listen to the island&#x2019;s city officials, who have seen fit to attach to it, like addendums, the nearby districts of Kintyre, Rockers, Bryce Hill, Dread Heights and &#x201c;Gola. <br>&nbsp;<br>Down there it is 11 April 1982, a day I have watched over and over again, as if from up here I could change things; could slip inside its hours and change the outcome. But I can only watch. <br>&nbsp;<br>For here is the truth: each day contains much more than its own hours, or minutes, or seconds. In fact, it would be no exag�geration to say that every day contains all of history.</p><h2>The Corrections</h2><p>The Corrections is a 2001 novel by American author Jonathan Franzen. It revolves around the troubles of an elderly Midwestern couple and their three adult children, tracing their lives from the mid-20th century to &#34;one last Christmas&#34; together near the turn of the millennium. The novel was awarded the National Book Award in 2001[1] and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 2002.</p><p></p><h2>1066: Year of the Conquest</h2><p>While the date 1066 is familiar to almost everybody as the year of the Norman conquest of England, few can place the event in the context of the dramatic year in which it took place. In this book, David Howarth attempts to bring alive the struggle for the succession to the English crown from the death of Edward the Confessor in January 1066 to the Christmas coronation of Duke William of Normandy. There is an almost uncanny symmetry, as well as a relentlessly exciting surge, of events leading to and from the Battle of Hastings. The author draws on the wealth of contemporary sources to describe Harold Godwinson&#39;s seizure of the throne, the brilliant defeat of the invasion from Norway at Stamford bridge and the forced march south to eventual defeat at Hastings. Howarth recounts events from the perspective of the common Englishman - describing how he worked, fought and died - and how he perceived from his isolated shire the overthrow of his world.</p><p><b>David Howarth</b> was a British officer and spymaster during World War II.

In a deft combination of thorough research and interesting narrative, Baldwin recreates life on the keelboats and flatboats that plied the Ohio, Mississippi, and other rivers from revolutionary days until about 1820. No one knows who put the first keel along the bottom of one big, clumsy river craft used by the pioneers. but the change made the boats far easier to manage, and travel in both directions became practical all the way to New Orleans.<br> <br> Baldwin examines the many types of craft in use, the different methods of locomotion, and the art of navigation on uncharted rivers full of hidden obstacles. But he never loses sight of the picturesque aspects of his subject, especially the boatmen themselves-a tribe of rugged and fearless men whose colorful lives are described in great detail.<br> <br> <i>The Keelboat Age on Western Waters</i> is a segment cut from the history of the frontier, showing the overwhelming importance of river transportation in the development of the West. The rivers were great arteries, carrying a restless people into a new land. The keelboatman and his craft did much to build a nation.</p></p><p>Leland D. Baldwin (1898-1981) was a&nbsp;professor of American history at the University of Pittsburgh and an authority on the history of western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Baldwin was director of the Western Pennsylvania Historical Survey, which produced 10 books in the late 1920's and 30's on the region's history.</p><h2>Mystics after Modernism: Discovering the Seeds of a New Science in the Renaissance (CW 7) (Classics in Anthroposophy)</h2><p>The mystics Steiner writes about in this book were early giants in the modern art of illumined self-knowledge. Their ways of seeing the world, God, and themselves foreshadowed all that we practice now in the best of meditation, both East and West. Here, you can read about their essential passion for unity, their practice of intensification of perception, and their ever-fresh insights into the process of knowing itself. <br><br><b>Contents:</b> <br><ul> <li> Foreword by Christopher Bamford </li><li> Preface to the 1923 Edition </li><li> Introduction: Mystics, Natural Science, and the Modern World (by Rudolf Steiner) </li><li> Meister Eckhart </li><li> The Friendship with God: Johannes Tauler </li><li> Cardinal Nicolas of Cusa </li><li> Agrippa of Nettesheim &amp; Theophrastus Paracelsus </li><li> Valentin Weigel &amp; Jacob Boehme </li><li> Giordano Bruno &amp; Angelus Silesius </li><li> Epilogue </li><li> Afterword: About the Author, the People, and the Background of This Book (by Paul M.

They managed to resolve the conflict between inner perceptions and the new seeds of modern science and human individuality. Based on the lives of those mystics and on his own spiritual insight, Steiner shows how their ideas can illuminate and preserve our true human nature today. <br><br>Rudolf Steiner ends his book with a quotation from the <i>Cherubinic Wanderer,</i> a collection of sayings gathered by Angelus Silesius: "Dear Friend, this is enough for now. If you wish to read more, go and become the writing and the essence yourself."<br><br>A previous edition was titled <i>Mysticism at the dawn of the Modern Age.</i></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Duck Season: Eating, Drinking, and Other Misadventures in Gascony--France&#39;s Last Best Place</h2><p><p>A delicious memoir about the eight months food writer David McAninch spent in Gascony&#x2014;a deeply rural region of France virtually untouched by mass tourism&#x2014;meeting extraordinary characters and eating the best meals of his life.</p><p>Though he&#x2019;d been a card-carrying Francophile all of his life, David McAninch knew little about Gascony, an ancient region in Southwest France mostly overlooked by Americans. Then an assignment sent him to research a story on duck. After enjoying a string of rich meals&#x2014;Armagnac-flamb�ed duck tenderloins; skewered duck hearts with chanterelles; a duck-confit shepherd&#x2019;s pie strewn with shavings of foie gras&#x2014;he soon realized what he&#x2019;d been missing.</p><p>McAninch decided he needed a more permanent fix. He&#x2019;d fallen in love&#x2014;not only with the food but with the people, and with the sheer unspoiled beauty of the place. So, along with his wife and young daughter, he moved to an old millhouse in the small village of Plaisance du Gers, where they would spend the next eight months living as Gascons. <em>Duck Season</em> is the delightful, mouthwatering chronicle of McAninch&#x2019;s time in this tradition-bound corner of France. There he herds sheep in the Pyrenees, harvests grapes, attends a pig slaughter, hunts for pigeons, distills Armagnac, and, of course, makes and eats all manner of delicious duck specialties&#x2014;learning to rewire his own thinking about cooking, eating, drinking, and the art of living a full and happy life.</p><p>With wit and warmth, McAninch brings us deep into this enchanting world, where eating what makes you happy isn&#x2019;t a sin but a commandment and where, to the eternal surprise of outsiders, locals&#x2019; life expectancy is higher than in any other region of France. Featuring a dozen choice recipes and beautiful line drawings, <em>Duck Season</em> is an irresistible treat for Francophiles and gourmands alike.</p></p><p><p><em>Welcome to Gascony, the other South of France: </em>a land where ducks outnumber people twenty to one, tourists are few, wine is still the midday drink of choice, and eating to your heart&#x2019;s content is not a sin but a commandment.</p><p>In this indelibly smart, affectionate culinary memoir, food writer and lifelong Francophile David<br>McAninch chronicles an eight-month epicurean journey in France&#x2019;s rural Southwest: the ancient Gallic cradle of foie gras, confit, and <em>magret de canard</em>, among other duck-centric delicacies. Intrigued by Gascony since traveling there on assignment for a cooking magazine, McAninch persuaded his wife and young daughter to move to a small, unprepossessing village in the Gers&#x2014;Gascony&#x2019;s heartland and one of the least urbanized d�partements in all of France&#x2014;and attempt to live as the Gascons do. </p><p>Installing his family in a drafty, two-hundred-year-old former textile mill straddling a river, McAninch sets out to master ultratraditional&#x2014;and unabashedly rich&#x2014;Gascon dishes, like wine-braised duck legs, <em>poule au pot</em>, <em>garbure</em> (a meaty peasant soup), and cured duck breast, and rustic yet exceedingly hard-to-pull-off desserts, including the formidable hearth-baked confection known as <em>g�teau � la broche</em>. He provisions his meals at the weekly market; imbibes the inky local wines; immerses himself in Gascony&#x2019;s history and folklore; and takes part, occasionally at the cost of his pride, in such local rites of passage as the pigeon hunt, the wine harvest, and the distillation of Armagnac. When McAninch succeeds in these endeavors&#x2014;and even more so when he doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;he learns some unexpected things about his potential as a cook, and ultimately undergoes a fundamental rewiring in the way he thinks about food, wine, and life in general.</p><p>Above all, he comes away with a profound, keen understanding of this remarkable corner of France&#x2014;and with a personal education in the indomitable joie de vivre of the Gascons, who, despite their immense appetites, enjoy the longest lifespan of any regional population in France. The locals he seeks out as mentors and teachers&#x2014;a matronly home cook, an octogenarian chef, a genteel winemaker, a pedantic historian, an ex&#x2014;rugby player, a Basque shepherd, a former undertaker, and various other bon vivants and gourmands&#x2014;prove to be the living embodiment of the deeply held French belief that joyful eating and drinking is not a privilege but a right.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and featuring a wonderful appendix of classic recipes, <em>Duck Season</em> is an irresistible invitation to embrace the pleasures of the table&#x2014;guiltlessly and with gusto&#x2014;and it joins such books as <em>A Year in Provence</em> and <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> in the canon of sensual, food-infused memoirs of European country life.</p><p>David McAninch is the features editor at <em>Chicago</em> magazine and was an editor at <em>Saveur</em> for nine years. His writing has appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>New York</em> magazine, the New York<em> Daily News</em>, <em>Newsday</em>, <em>Rodale&#x2019;s</em><em> Organic Life</em>, and <em>Departures</em>, among other publications. He lives in Chicago with his wife and daughter.</p></p><h2>Foucault and Queer Theory (Postmodern Encounters)</h2><p>Michel Foucault is the most gossiped-about celebrity of French poststructuralist theory. The homophobic insult 'queer' is now proudly reclaimed by some who once called themselves lesbian or gay. What is the connection between the two? <p>This is a postmodern encounter between Foucault's theories of sexuality, power and discourse and the current key exponents of queer thinking who have adpted, revised and criticised Foucault. Our understanding of gender, identity, sexuality and cultural politics will be radically altered in this meeting of transgressive figures. </p><p>"Foucault and Queer Theory" excels as a brief introduction to Foucault's compelling ideas and the development of queer culture with its own outspoken views on heteronormativity, sado-masochism, performativity, transgender, the end of gender, liberation-versus-difference, late capitalism and the impact of AIDS on theories and practices.</p></p><p>Tamsin Spargo worked as an actor before taking up her current position as Senior Lecturer in Literary and Historical Studies at Liverpool John Moores University. She writes on religious writing, critical and cultural theory and desire.There's been a lot of queer stuff going on in universities recently. Barbie, Shakespeare, even Jane Austen have been given a queer makeover. On the streets Bart Simpson is seen sporting a pink triangle, and the word 'queer', once hurled or whispered as an insult is now proudly claimed as a marker of transgression by people who once called themselves lesbian or gay. What's it all about? <p>A few years ago, the controller of Channel 4 was described as a 'pornographer in chief' because of the perceived sexual content of his programming. The world-wide web and satellite porn channels were seen as threatening to breach the defences of our island state of innocence. Now, it seems, everyone's at it, or rather talking about it. We've seen documentaries and dramas about prostitution, the vice squad, the sexual habits of evry type of animal under the sun. If a programme has talking heads, chances are they'll be taking about doing it. And if you don't want to do it, you'd better keep quiet (celibacy's not sexy any more) or try tantric sex. It's Madonna's latest thing, apparently, and she should know. </p><p>In politics, the old equation of power and sexiness still seems to triumph over principles and aesthetics alike. Although ga politicians are still being 'outed', being gay is not, it seems, the problem it once was for those with ruling ambitions. The press has repeatedly reported a growing climate of 'tolerance', as "The Sun" announced an end to gay-bashing editorials. Although gay and lesbian characters in soap operas are generally all too respectable, the flamboyant camp of Julian Clary and Eddie Izzard's transvestism have contributed to their success. It seems we're altogether a more open, more tolerant, sexier society - and it's getting better all the time. Or is it? Is mainstream culture just flirting with a bit of the other in order to keep us all on a broadly straight line? </p><p>While there does seem to be a broader definition of acceptable sexual behaviour, many of the old prejucices remain, and new crises are always in the making. Scenes of mob hysteria about convicted or even suspected paedophiles reveal the fightening side of people power. Freud may have uncovered infantile sexuality, but it's not something late 20th-century society can discuss rationally. There seems to be a crisis about how to cope with 'sex offenders' generally. Are they ill, and if so, what's the cure? Or are they 'evil'? What or whom are they offending? Nature, the Law, Society? </p><p>And how, more generally, do we know what makes one erotic activity good and another bad? Is it a matter of divine ordinance, biological nature, or social convention? Can we really be sure that our own desires and pleasures are normal, natural, nice - or that we are? Why does sex matter so much? </p><p>As the anthropologist Gayle Rubin argues: 'The realm of sexuality has its own internal politics, inequities, and modes of oppression. As with other aspects of human behaviour, the concrete instutional forms of sexuality at any given time and place are products of human activity. They are imbued with conflicts of interest and political manoeuvring, both deliberate and incidental. In that sense, sex is always political. But there are also historical periods in which sexuality is more sharply contested and overtly politicized. In such periods, the domain of erotic life is, in effect, renegotiated.' </p><p>If, as it seems, we are living in such a moment, then one of the ways in which erotic life is currently being renegotiated is through the exploration of how we understand sex in the ways we do. While this exploration may be going on in a myriad of contexts - in the media, in medicine, in parliament - the analysis which is the focus of this essay has been undertaken most energetically by individuals and groups who have experienced the fullest, and at times deadliest, effects of the politics of sex. As women were the first group to explore gender difference, so lesbians, gay men and other groups whose sexualities are defined against the norm of heterosexuality have been foremost in the exploration of the politics of sexuality. In challenging our most basic assumptions about sex, gender and sexuality, including the oppositions between heterosexual and homosexual, biological sex and culturally determined gender, and man and woman, these thinkers are developing new ways of exploring the issue of human identity.</p></p><h2>How to Tuck in Your Sleepy Lion</h2><p>Discover the big moments and daily routines of every toddler&#39;s life with lovable animal characters and a playful rhyming text.

Originally formulated to combat the oppression of black people, Fanon&#39;s insights are now being taken up by other oppressed groups - including feminists - and used in their struggle for cultural and political autonomy.

Jesus's gospel of the kingdom of God helps us recover a personal and social commitment to the common good and shows us--in concrete ways--how to be both personally responsible and socially just. Working together, we can reshape our churches, society, politics, and economy.<br><br>In the midst of contentious national debates on gun control, immigration, budget deficits, and more, this book moves the conversations beyond current media and political warfare to bring together a divided country. Wallis explores how Jesus's agenda can serve the common good, what it takes to sustain a lifelong commitment to social justice, and how reading the Bible as well as the culture can shape our lives for genuine transformation.</p><p><b>Finding Common Ground for the Common Good<br></b><br>"Personal/political, religion/politics, faith/power, ideology/pragmatism . . . Jim Wallis is a wrestler of values, ideas, and policies and how they interact to shape the world we live in.

His is a profound and always-entertaining voice of reason, reconciliation, and passion for social justice and peace.

By the author of Illiberal Education. 125,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>"Virtually all contemporary liberal assumptions about the origin of racism, its historical significance, its contemporary effects, and what to do about it are wrong," announces Dinesh D'Souza in another characteristically thought-provoking and controversial book. His scrupulously researched study of the history, nature, and effects of racism will certainly ruffle many feathers--particularly those of cultural relativists and liberal "antiracists" whose opinions he aims to discredit. But thinkers of all political persuasions would benefit from reading this self-described conservative's eloquently presented views as he "excavates beyond the usual digging sites" to present a unique and troubling vision of the "neurotic obsession" with race that continues to divide American society.<p> Much of what D'Souza says flies in the face of liberal doctrine. He maintains that there are cultural differences that account for distinct levels of achievement among races, and that racism cannot be blamed for "black failure." He argues that racism is not a universal phenomenon but a relatively recent Western intellectual concept, and because we can trace racism's beginning we can likewise bring about its demise. He deals blow after blow to longstanding "myths" about race, criticizing the "civil rights industry," rejecting "misguided" solutions such as multiculturalism and proportional representation as "fighting discrimination by practicing it," and even calls for a repeal of the near-sacred Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p><p> This is not an easy book to read, but it is an important one. Even if more than a few disagree with D'Souza's assumptions and arguments, all should welcome his well-considered, insightful treatment of this immensely difficult topic. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i></p>Dinesh D&#39;Souza is a Research Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.</p><h2>Autobiography of a Yogi</h2><p><i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> is at once a beautifully written account of an exceptional life and a profound introduction to the ancient science of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation. This acclaimed autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of one of the great spiritual figures of our time. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda tells the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounter with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West. The author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence. Selected as "One of the 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Twentieth Century," <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> has been translated into 20 languages, and is regarded worldwide as a classic of religious literature. Several million copies have been sold, and it continues to appear on best-seller lists after more than sixty consecutive years in print. Profoundly inspiring, it is at the same time vastly entertaining, warmly humorous and filled with extraordinary personages. <b>Self-Realization Fellowship's</b> editions, and none others, include extensive material added by the author after the first edition was published, including a final chapter on the closing years of his life.</p><p>Autobiography of a Yogi is not an ordinary book. It is a spiritual treasure. To read its message of hope to all truthseekers, is to begin a great adventure. This is a verbatim reprinting of the original, 1946 edition of "Autobiography of a Yogi". Although subsequent printings, reflecting revisions made after the author's death in 1952, have sold over a million copies and have been translated into more than 19 languages, the few thousand of the original have long since disappeared into the hands of collectors. Now, with this reprint, the 1946 edition is again available, with all its inherent power, just as the great master of yoga first presented it. <p>Editions past the third have been prepared since the author's passing in 1952. In 1953, Self-Realization Fellowship, acquired the rights to "Autobiography of a Yogi" from Philosophical Library; it has been the publisher of all subsequent editions, until this original reprint put out by Crystal Clarity, Publishers.

Evans-Wentz, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc. <p>Jesus College, Oxford; Author of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, etc. </p><p>The value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book about yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West. </p><p>It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines*(1). It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. </p><p>Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, "Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion. </p><p>I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages W. Y.

While executives from within the ranks know the challenges, culture, and politics of a company, newcomers face a corporate minefield. <i>Right from the Start</i> is Ciampa and Watkins's survival manual for leaders taking starting work at a new company. "Leadership is never easy," they write. "This is never truer than when a new leader enters an organization from the outside and must change its culture in fundamental ways." Through interviews with dozens of corporate leaders who have succeeded or failed in such transitions, the authors provide a strategy for getting it right from the outset.<p> Ciampa, an independent consultant, and Watkins, a Harvard Business School associate professor, advise three key missions for new leaders: Create momentum; master the ability to learn, convey a vision, and build coalitions; and know and manage yourself well. A fast start is especially crucial. In fact, they say, the most important period starts with the recruitment or interview process and runs through the first six months in a new role. <i>Right from the Start</i> provides plenty of real-life examples of successes and failures, in everything from building coalitions to changing corporate culture. The stories tend to suffer sometimes because the executives remain anonymous. Nonetheless, the book is instructive for business people assuming new management roles. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>"Leadership transition is one of the most important and difficult tasks a manager will face. Ciampa and Watkins' insights-particularly about the 'early days'-and their advice for meeting these challenges are indispensable." -Henry Schacht, Director and Senior Advisor, Lucent Technologies "Ciampa and Watkins' analysis speaks to leadership in the private sector, but every page in the book yields help and insight for those of us in the public or nonprofit world as well. Right from the Start intertwines telling vignettes with advice that leaders will want follow-before it's too late." -Robert L. Gallucci, Former Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, and Dean, School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University "This book makes a great gift for friends who have just been appointed to new jobs. Right from the Start covers all the essentials for managing a smooth transition, a process critical to attaining leadership success. Read it now. Then read it again when you get your next promotion." -Major General Perry M. Smith, Author of Rules and Tools for Leaders, and President, Visionary Leadership Ltd. "Right from the Start skips the abstract theories and tired platitudes of so many leadership books and gets to what works-a tried-and-true practical framework for making the bottom line hum. Those who take leadership seriously cannot afford to overlook this book." (Gerard R. Roche, Chairman of the Board, Heidrick &amp; Struggles) "Right from the Start is a superb handbook for executives in transition-a trenchant, engaging, and continuously rewarding guide through the crucial start-up period for a new leader."

But you can shorten the round trip by 14 mi (22.5 km) and significantly increase the reward-to-effort ratio by dropping into Twentyfive&#x2019;s impressive lower reaches via Fox Canyon.<br><br>To do so you must navigate cross-country to Fox Canyon, then enter it by way of a short but steep friction-walk. If you have any routefinding experience, the 1 mi (1.6 km) across trail-less terrain will pose no difficulty as long as you carry a compass in one hand and the 1:24 000 topo map in the other. As for dropping into Fox, the slickrock-ramp entry appears more committing than it actually is. A nervous novice might manage it on the seat of his hopefully double-bottomed shorts if not on the soles of his boots. <br><br>The entire trip is scenic. From the trailhead, you&#x2019;ll hike on rolling sandstone across the outer edge of Early Weed Bench, with sweeping views of canyon country. Fox Canyon is short but intriguingly narrow. And while &#x201c;wash&#x201d; aptly describes most of Twentyfive Mile, the stretch you&#x2019;ll be hiking is a full-blown canyon. The bulbous sandstone walls tower above and occasionally overhang the meandering trickle you&#x2019;ll follow to the Mother Escalante.<br><br> Beyond the confluence of Fox Canyon and Twentyfive Mile Wash, navigation is simple: just head downstream, without being diverted up the four primary tributary drainages. The hiking, however, might not be a total cakewalk. In the past, the riparian vegetation has been thick and ornery � la Southeast Asia.<br><br>Before Your Trip<br>Stop at the Escalante Interagency Visitor Center before driving the Hole-inthe-Rock Road. Get a current weather report, ask about the condition of the road, and find out how deep the Escalante River is likely to be.<br><br>The stream in lower Twentyfive Mile is often a trickle: shallow enough to walk in without soaking your footwear, narrow enough to easily hop across. But in case it&#x2019;s not, amphibious footwear is preferable. Wear technical sandals designed for hiking, or fabric hiking boots you don&#x2019;t mind dunking. If you intend to continue in the Escalante River, dunkable boots are essential.<br><br>By Vehicle <br>From Boulder, at the junction of Hwy 12 and Burr Trail Road, drive Hwy 12 west, then generally south. At 12.7 mi (20.4 km), just past Calf Creek Rec Area, reset your trip odometer to 0 on the Escalante River bridge. Proceed south. At 4.5 mi (7.2 km) stop at the scenic overlook, then proceed west. At 9.5 mi (15.3 km) turn left (south) onto the signed, unpaved Hole-in-the-Rock Road.<br><br>From the southeast edge of Escalante, near the high school, drive Hwy 12 generally southeast. At 4.5 mi (7.3 km) turn right (south) onto the signed, unpaved Hole-in-the-Rock Road.<br><br> From either approach, depart Hwy 12, reset your trip odometer to 0, and follow the Hole-in-the-Rock Road southeast. At 23.5 mi (37.8 km) turn left onto Early Weed Bench Road, reset your trip odometer to 0, and follow it northeast. At 4.7 mi (7.6 km), bear right (east) ignoring the 4WD road forking left. Reach the trailhead at 5.2 mi (8.4 km), 5490 ft (1673 m). Park here. A sandstone knoll is visible on the rim directly east. The road continues east-southeast to the Early Weed Bench trailhead at 5.6 mi (9 km). <br><br>On Foot <br>Study the 1:24 000 topo map before departing. Your immediate goal, Fox Canyon, is easy to identify though it&#x2019;s unlabeled. It&#x2019;s about 1 mi (1.6 km) north-northeast of the trailhead. It runs generally north / south, along the left (west)<br><br>boundary of Glen Canyon National Rec Area.<br><br> Begin hiking north, over the rim. Follow the path of least resistance across undulating sandstone, gradually bearing right (north-northeast). The steep canyon walls near the confluence of Fox Canyon and Twentyfive Mile Wash are visible north.<br><br> Aim for the prominent, brown-topped butte. At 1 mi (1.6 km), 4880 ft (1488 m), proceed generally north, above the left (west) rim of Fox Canyon. Cross the shallow tail of a minor tributary.<br><br> Shortly beyond, curve right (northeast) and begin a steep friction-walk on a slick rock ramp dropping to a sandy bench. Follow a path right (south) down to the floor of Fox Canyon. Then turn left (north) and hike down-canyon. At 1.8 mi (2.9 km), 4580 ft (1396 m), intersect Twentyfive Mile Wash. Follow it downstream (right / east), soon curving left (north). It meanders constantly, but your general direction of travel will remain northeast all the way to the Escalante River.<br><br> Water within Twentyfive Mile Wash should be less turbid and contaminated than the Escalante, so refill water bottles en route.<br>At 3.6 mi (5.8 km) continue east, ignoring a tributary drainage (left / north). At 4.1 mi (6.6 km), continue northeast, ignoring a sheer-walled tributary drainage (right / south). Ignore two more tributary drainages (left / north, and right /south) within the ensuing 2 mi (3.2 km).<br><br> Reach the Escalante River at 7.6 mi (12.2 km), 4460 ft (1360 m).

She didn't want to get up most mornings, but today was especially bad. After she killed the alarm clock, she just wanted to roll over and go back to sleep. But she couldn't. She knew it. She had a Russian test first period, and a Young Socialists' League meeting after school. That meant she'd be up late with schoolwork tonight, too, and sleepy again tomorrow morning.Even so, she didn't want to get up.When she didn't start moving fast enough to suit her mother, she got shaken and pushed out of bed. She muttered and groaned in protest--she had trouble talking till she was really awake, which took a while.Her mother showed no sympathy ... and no mercy. "Come on. Get dressed," she said. "Breakfast will be ready by the time you are.""<i>S�, s�</i>," Annarita said. By then she was standing up. Her mother went away, knowing she probably wouldn't lie down again.Because there was a meeting, Annarita put on her Young Socialists' League uniform. It made her look ready to change a tire: marching boots, khaki trousers, dark green blouse. But all the Young Socialists--the up-and-comers--would be wearingthe same thing today, so what could she do? Not much. Not anything, really.She put on the crisscross sashes, one with the badges of Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin and Putin, the other with badges of Moroni and Chiapelli and other Italian Communist heroes. The badges of the Russians and the founders were edged in gold, those of the Italians in silver. Annarita didn't know how many times she'd put on the sashes, but she'd never even thought about that before. It was as if her own countrymen were runners-up in the race for fame.She shook her head. It wasn't as if. Italian Communist heroes were heroes only in Italy. Other Socialist people's republics had their own national heroes. You saw them, grim and unsmiling, on foreign postage stamps. But the founders and the Russians were heroes all over the world. <i>They should be</i>, she thought. <i>If not for them, Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism might not have won. And then where would we be?</i>"Annarita!" her mother yelled."Coming!" She knew where she needed to be: the kitchen.It was crowded in there. The Crosettis shared the kitchen and bathroom with the Mazzillis, who were also eating breakfast. Everyone muttered good morning. Annarita grabbed a roll, tore it, and dipped it in olive oil. A cup of cappuccino was waiting for her. Her mother and father poured down espresso instead, thick and sweet and strong. If two or three of those little cups wouldn't get your heart started in the morning, you were probably dead.Sitting across the table from her was Gianfranco Mazzilli, who was sixteen--a year younger than Annarita--and went to the same school. He just had on ordinary clothes, though. Hedidn't belong to the Young Socialists, which made his parents unhappy.His father used espresso to knock back a shot of grappa, and then another one. That would get your heart started, too. Of course, after a while you might not remember <i>why</i> you got it started, but Cristoforo Mazzilli didn't seem to care.Annarita's father eyed the bottle of distilled lightning and said, "I wish I could get going like that.""Why can't you, Filippo?" Cristoforo Mazzilli said. "Doesn't hurt me a bit.""I should keep a clear head," Annarita's father answered. "The patients need it.""'From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs,'" the elder Mazzilli quoted. He reached for the grappa bottle. "I need this." He was a midlevel Party functionary in one of the provincial ministries. No one would get hurt if he came to work a little tipsy, or more than a little tipsy, or if he didn't come in at all. Knowing that might have been one reason he drank.As soon as people finished eating, they started jockeying for the bathroom. There were apartments--some right here in this building--where families fought like cats and dogs over the tub and the toilet. The Crosettis and the Mazzillis didn't do that, anyhow. Both families had to use the facilities, whether they got along or not. Easier when they did, so everybody tried. It worked pretty well ... most of the time.Going down the stairs, Annarita carried her books in front of her. Gianfranco carried his under one arm. Girls did the one thing, boys the other. Annarita didn't know why, or how long it had been that way. Maybe, if she remembered, she would askher mother. Did it go back further than that? She shrugged. She had no idea."Spring," Gianfranco said when they got outside."Spring," Annarita agreed. Spring here in Milan was a lot more hesitant than it was down in Rome, let alone Naples or Sicily. It stayed cool and humid. It could rain--it could come down in buckets. The sun was out right now. But clouds floated across the sky. If the sun hid behind one of them, it might not feel like coming out again.Other students were coming out of the building, and from the identical concrete towers to either side. Stalin Gothic, people called them--when they were sure no informers were listening, anyhow.Not far away stood the Duomo. The great cathedral was Gothic, too, only it was the genuine article. Every line of it seemed to leap for the sky, to point toward the heavens. Officially, the Italian People's Republic was as atheistic as the Soviet Union or any other Socialist state. Officially. In spite of Stalin's cruel joke--"The Pope? How many divisions has he got?"--His Holiness Pius XIV still presided over St. Peter's. Some churches stayed open. You weren't supposed to believe any of that stuff, but a lot of people did.Annarita glanced from the Duomo to the grim, square apartment blocks and back again. The apartments looked as if they'd been run up in six weeks. They probably had, judging by the plumbing. The elevator in her building hadn't worked for years. She and Gianfranco had come down the stairs. They would climb them in the afternoon, too.The Duomo ... They'd started building it in the fourteenth century, and hadn't finished till the twentieth. That seemed--that was--an awfully long time, but they got it right. Yes, it glorifiedsuperstition. So her teachers said, at least half a dozen times a day. But glorify it did.In the square in front of the Duomo stood a statue of General Secretary Putin. <i>Old Pointy-Nose</i>, people called him. Not counting the base, he stood four meters tall--twice the height of even a tall man. All the same, the cathedral had no trouble making him seem like a midget.At the moment, a pigeon perched on his outstretched right forefinger. Gianfranco pointed to it. "Looking for a handout," he said."Good luck," Annarita said. "The bird better hope that fist doesn't close." Even though Gianfranco grinned and nodded, she wished she had the words back the second they were out of her mouth. Vladimir Putin was seventy years dead, yes, but making any kind of joke about him to a Party man's son wasn't smart. But <i>everybody</i> knew the Russians were so much better at taking than giving.Fiats and Russian Volgas and smelly German Trabants and Workermobiles from the USA crowded narrow streets that hadn't been built with cars in mind in the first place. A century and more of Communism hadn't turned Italians into orderly drivers. Annarita didn't think anything could. A Volga stopped in the middle of the street to wait for an old woman on the far curb. It plugged traffic like a cork in a bottle. A trolley had to stop behind the Volga. More cars jammed up behind the trolley. The motorman clanged his bell. The drivers leaned on their horns. The man in the Volga ignored them all.The old lady tottered over and got in. The Volga zoomed away. The trolley got moving, too. The swarm of cars behind it would take longer to unknot."There ought to be a law," Gianfranco said."There <i>are</i> laws," Annarita said. "People don't pay any attention to them.""That trolleyman should have photographed the guy's license plate," Gianfranco said. "When they found out who he was, they could have fixed him good.""Maybe the trolleyman did," Annarita said."Yeah, maybe." Gianfranco sounded as if he liked the idea. Annarita wasn't so sure she did. They already had so many ways to keep an eye on you. Who needed a motorman with a camera? Even typewriters were registered. As far as the Italian People's Republic was concerned, they were more dangerous than assault rifles. And computers ... Her school had a couple, which made it special, but only the most trusted teachers and the very most trusted students got to use them.She thought the progress to real Communism, the kind where the state withered away, would come faster if people could more freely use the tools they had. No matter what she thought, she kept her ideas to herself. What you didn't tell anybody, you couldn't get in trouble for.While she was thinking dark thoughts, her feet kept walking. She turned right and then left and then right again. She hardly noticed the apartment blocks and shops she passed."We're here," Gianfranco said."S�," Annarita said. "We're here. Oh, boy." Gianfranco laughed. He was more likely to say something like that. She was the good student--he just squeaked by. But she couldn't make herself get excited about school today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Enver Hoxha Polytechnic Academy was named for a Communist hero, but not for an Italian Communist hero. Hoxha had administeredAlbania for most of the second half of the twentieth century. A lot of Italians laughed at Albanians, their neighbors across the Adriatic Sea. Few did it it where Albanians could hear them, though. Albanians were supposed to have nasty tempers, and to be fond of carrying knives.Students from other schools jeered Hoxha Polytechnic's soccer and basketball teams because the academy bore a foreigner's name. "Odd jobs!" they shouted. "Odd jobs!" Despite a century and a half of Socialism, Albania remained the poorest country in Europe. Young Albanians sometimes crossed the Adriatic in small boats. Working as farm laborers or handymen--or thieves--in Italy seemed better to them than going hungry back home.A big black-and-white photo of Hoxha stared down at Annarita and Gianfranco from over the entrance. He didn't look as if he approved of them. He didn't look as if he approved of anybody. Considering what he'd had to do to drive the Fascists out of Albania during the Second World War and then rule the country for so long afterwards, he probably didn't."See you," Gianfranco said, and hurried off to his first class."Ciao," Annarita called after him. She didn't want to go to Russian. It drove her crazy. Everybody who wanted to be anybody had to learn it. It was the most important language in the world, after all. When the Soviet Union sneezed, the rest of the world started sniffling. But still ...Annarita had had a couple of years of Latin. She understood the idea of cases, of using endings instead of prepositions to show how words worked in a sentence. <i>Homo</i> was a man as the subject of a sentence. If a man thanked you, he was <i>homo</i>. But if you thanked him, if he was the object, he was <i>hominem</i>. In thepossessive, he was <i>hominis</i>. A man's dog was <i>canus</i> hominis--or <i>hominis canus</i>. Word order mattered much less in Latin than in Italian. The same was true in Russian, only more so.But if Latin's grammar was weird, an awful lot of the vocabulary looked familiar. <i>Man</i> in Italian was <i>uomo</i>, while <i>dog</i> was <i>cane</i>. You didn't need to know any history to see that Latin and Italian were related.Russian's vocabulary, though, seemed even weirder to Annarita than its grammar did. <i>Man</i> in Russian was <i>chelovek</i>, and <i>dog</i> was <i>sobaka</i>. Worse, the Russians used a different alphabet, so everything looked funny. <i>Man</i> looked like <i></i>e<i></i>oBek, and dog looked like Co<i></i>aka. Some of the letters were recognizable, but others would fool you. C was sounded like "s," P was "r," and H was "n." If you weren't careful, if you absentmindedly thought the way you usually did, Russian could really bite you."Dobry den," the teacher said when Annarita walked into the classroom."Dobry <i>den, Tovarishch</i> Montefusco," she answered. <i>Good day, Comrade Montefusco</i>. That was polite, but she wondered if she really meant it. How could a day with a test in it be a good day?He waited till the bell, and not an instant longer. "And now, the test," he said, still in Russian. His accent was very good. He'd spent a long time studying in Russia. Some people whispered that he'd spent some time in a camp there. Annarita had no idea if that was true. Nobody'd ever had the nerve to ask him.He handed out the mimeographed sheets. Mimeograph machines and copiers were kept under lock and key. Annarita understood that. Counterrevolutionaries could use them toreproduce propaganda harmful to the state. As far as she was concerned, this test was harmful to her state of mind.It was hard. She'd known it would be. They wanted to find out who was just good and who was the very best. The very best--and the ones with the very best connections--would run things when they grew up. The ones who weren't quite good enough for that would get more ordinary jobs instead.The ones who didn't measure up would miss out on other things, too. They wouldn't be able to travel abroad. They wouldn't get the best vacation houses by the ocean or up in the mountains. They wouldn't get the best apartments in the city, either. And they would spend years on the waiting list for a tiny, miserable Trabant, with a motor that sounded like a tin can full of rocks and angry bees, instead of getting a fancy Zis or a Ferrari or a Mercedes.So Annarita knew what was at stake every time she wrote her name--A<i></i><i></i>ap<i></i><i></i>a Kpoc<i></i><i></i><i></i>--on a test form. The privileges and luxuries that went with being the very best didn't drive her all that much, though they were nice. But the idea of being at the center of things, being where the action was--that pushed her. So did the idea of proving she really was the best to a world that didn't care one way or the other.She got to work. Even counting in Russian was complicated. Numbers changed case like any other adjectives. And the nouns that followed them changed case, too, with strange rules. One house stayed in the nominative--the case for the subject. Two, three, or four houses (or anything else) went to the genitive singular--the case for the possessive. <i>Three of house</i>, it meant literally. Five or more houses and you used the genitive again, but the plural this time. <i>Seven of houses</i> was the literal meaning.<i>"</i>Bozhemoi!" Annarita muttered to herself. That meant <i>My God!</i> It wasn't good Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist doctrine, but it was perfectly good Russian. Comrade Montefusco said it when somebody made a dumb mistake in class. Annarita had heard real Russians say it on TV and on the radio, too. From everything she could tell, Russians were less polite than Italians, or polite in a different way.She fought through the test. She was still in the middle of rechecking when the teacher said, "Pass them forward, please." She sighed and did. She wasn't sure about a couple of things, but she thought she'd done well.&lt;...</p><h2>Exposition of Isaiah, One-Volume Edition</h2><p>Exposition of Isaiah Volume I Chapters 1-39 by H. C.

Previously an associate pastor at Life Christian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, she developed, coordinated, and taught a weekly meeting known as "Life In The Word." After more than five years, the Lord brought it to a conclusion, directing her to establish her own ministry and call it "Life In The Word, Inc." <p>Now, her Life In The Word radio and television broadcasts are seen and heard by millions across the United States and throughout the world. Joyce's teaching tapes are enjoyed internationally, and she travels extensively conducting Life In The Word conferences. </p><p>Joyce and her husband, Dave, the business administrator at Life In The Word, have been married for over 35 years. They reside in St. Louis, Missouri, and are the parents of four children. All four children are married and, along with their spouses, work with Dave and Joyce in the ministry. </p><p>Believing the call on her life is to establish believers in God's Word, Joyce says, "Jesus died to set the captives free, and far too many Christians have little or no victory in their daily lives." Finding herself in the same situation many years ago and having found freedom to live in victory through applying God's Word, Joyce goes equipped to set captives free and to exchange ashes for beauty. She believes that every person who walks in victory leads many others into victory. Her life is transparent, and her teachings are practical and can be applied in everyday life. </p><p>Joyce has taught on emotional healing and related subjects in meetings all over the country, helping multiplied thousands. She has recorded more than 230 different audio-cassette albums and over 75 videos. She has also authored 49 books to help the body of Christ on various topics.</p>&#34;We want people to receive healing in every area of life--spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, and socially.

Rescuing the proud ship Queen Ravenna from destruction, Tremaine and a resolute band of sorcerers and warriors set sail across magical seas on a voyage of danger and discovery. For the secret to defeating the enemy -- and to rescuing the world from the Gardier's inimitable hatred -- lies far beyond the walls of the world, and only the tenuous ties of friendship and honor will keep the band together.</p><p>But the Gardier are not the only evil in this tumultuous world, and an ancient terror stalks the ornate rooms and shadowy decks of the Queen Ravenna -- a force so malevolent and enigmatic that even the growing power of the sorcerer's sphere may not be enough to save Ile-Rien from utter ruin.</p></p><p>Martha Wells is the author of fourteen fantasy novels, including <i>The Wizard Hunters</i>, <i>The Ships of Air,</i> <i>The Gate of Gods</i>, <i>The Element of Fire</i>, and the Nebula-nominated <i>The Death of the Necromancer</i>. Her newest novel, <i>The Cloud Roads</i>, was published in March 2011 by Night Shade Books, and the sequel, <i>The Serpent Sea</i>, in January 2012. Her next fantasy novels will be <i>The Siren Depths</i>, to be published by Night Shade in December 2013, and <i>Emilie and the Hollow World</i>, to be published by Strange Chemistry Books in April 2013. She has had short stories in the magazines <i>Black Gate</i>, <i>Realms of Fantasy</i>, <i>Lone Star Stories</i>, and <i>Stargate Magazine</i>, and in the Tsunami Relief anthology <i>Elemental</i>. She has also written two media-tie-in novels, <i>Stargate Atlantis: Reliquary</i> and <i>Stargate Atlantis: Entanglement</i>.The country of Ile-Rien has fallen to the Gardier, a mysterious enemy whose sorcerous weapons more than match rifles and artillery. Tremaine Valiarde, a notorious sorcerer's dilettante daughter, has begun to unlock the powers of her father's magical sphere, the only weapon that may work against the Gardier. But she is on the run and doesn't know who may be an enemy spy. Moreover, the Gardier operate in more than one world. As this book begins, Tremaine and her comrades are trying to return to their homeland the Gardier captives rescued at the end of <i>The Wizard Hunters</i> [BKL My 1 03] and form an alliance with them. Differing customs across and between worlds make this tricky, and since the Gardier occupy Tremaine's homeland, information and assistance is hard to come by. Wells has wrought characters and cultures well, but here they multiply so that one hopes that lists of both will appear in the next Ile-Rien book. Otherwise, this sequel is well done, though easier to appreciate with its predecessor under one's belt. <i>Frieda Murray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Davis teaches at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York and lives with her husband and daughter in Vermont.My soul is going on a trip. I want to talk about her. I want to talk about her. <br>Why would anyone ever want to talk about anything else?<br> My soul is a girl: she is just like me. She is fourteen years old <br>and has been promised in marriage to the French Dauphin, who also has a <br>soul though more visible and worldly, its body already formed (so I"ve been <br>told) from layers of flesh and fat. In France they piss into chamber pots made <br>of lapis and dine on common garden slugs. In France their hands smell like <br>vanilla and they shoot their fl�ches <br>d"amour indiscriminately in all directions, flowing to their taste for books <br>pernicious to religion and morals.<br> My soul is also powerful, but like a young girl it has wishes and <br>ideas&#x2014;yes! &#x2014; a soul can have ideas like a mind does. "Antonia, Antonia, <br>you must pay attention," I can still hear Abb� Vermond implore me, waving a <br>book in my face when all I wanted to do was dance dance dance, as if he <br>actually believed that to be light of heart is the same as being light of head.<br> We traveled in a carriage coated with glass and lined with pale <br>blue satin, beautifully swift, magnificently sprung. The end of April and the <br>clouds compact and quick-moving, the fields turning from pale to deeper <br>green, and the fruit trees" veiled heads humming with bees. From Vienna to <br>Molck, from the valley of the Danube to the Castle of Nymphenburg, whose <br>inhabitants behaved like swine. Bells pealed all along our route and uniformed <br>men shot off guns; little girls tossed flower petals in our path. The white <br>horses of the Danube were here one minute, gone the next; one minute we <br>slipped into the Black Forest"s long cool shadows, the next out onto a hot <br>sunny plain.<br> "The world where you must pass your life is but transitory," or so <br>advised my papa from beyond the grave. "There is naught save eternity that is <br>without end." In my lap I had my dear little pug, the smell of whose ears will <br>always be sweeter to me than all the perfumes of Araby and the scent of <br>heliotrope combined.<br> Twenty thousand horses stabled along the road from Vienna to <br>Strasbourg&#x2014;no sooner did one of our steeds begin to lather up and stumble <br>than it was ground into cat meat and a new one found to take its place. <br>Serving women, hairdressers, dressmakers, surgeons, furriers, chaplains, <br>apothecaries, cooks. Each night we managed to consume 150 chickens, 270 <br>pounds of beef, 220 pounds of veal, 55 pounds of bacon, 50 pigeons, 300 <br>eggs.<br> I was eager to please, though that meant something other than <br>acquiesce to another"s desire. Pleasing meant my own desire: the place <br>where my body and soul met, like the musician"s bow bearing down on the <br>string, teasing a sound out: ah ah ah ah ah!<br> My soul thought she"d be happy, and then, one day, she"d die.<br> But, die.<br> What does this mean?<br> One day Antoinette will not exist, though her soul will continue to <br>flourish.<br> And WHO IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT?<br> By the time we stopped for supper at the Abbey of Schuttern I had <br>no appetite at all, even though the nuns tried tempting me with pilchards and <br>apricots and kugelhopf; I admit I wept a little. It was the sixth of May; we"d <br>been on the road for over two weeks. From my bedroom window I could see <br>the Rhine, which looked wide and flat and the color of lead, and the light on it <br>looked like the pilchards had, silver and skinny and unappetizing. I heard a <br>door creak, the sound of footsteps. Angry voices arguing below, fighting over <br>the wording in the marriage contract, by which I was to be deeded away like <br>a cottage or a plot of land to the people of France. A fork of lightning over the <br>Rhine, and the Lorelei"s long ghostly arm lifting to meet it . . .<br> But Mama would never let me get away with such silly thoughts&#x2014;<br>I missed her so much I thought I"d die. "You must eat everything on your <br>plate, Antonia. No picking and choosing. Why have you not eaten all your <br>fish? How many times must I tell you that the child who gives in to foolish <br>fears will never amount to much as an adult. Come here, let me take a good <br>look at you&#x2014;" peering at me through a magnifying glass. "You seem so <br>small for your age. How is your health?" Her white white hair and her white <br>white teeth, one of which she"d had pulled while giving birth to me. Antoinette <br>and a decayed molar, both of us rejected by my mother"s body about eight <br>o"clock in the evening, All Souls" Day, 1755.<br> It was getting dark; the moon was coming up over the river. At <br>home Carlotta would be saying her prayers and Maxie sneaking cheese to <br>his pet mouse, poor Anna lying there with her hands folded across her chest <br>like an effigy of herself, unable to stop coughing. Joseph and Christina, <br>Elizabeth and Karl. Amalia, Leopold, Johanna, Josepha. Mama sitting in her <br>private apartments, sipping her warm milk and signing state papers. Her head <br>shorn and the walls draped in black ever since Papa"s death, which she <br>recorded in her prayer book, "Emperor Francis I, my husband, died on the <br>18th of August at half past nine o"clock. Our happy marriage lasted 29 years, <br>six months and six days, 1,540 weeks, 10,781 days, 258,774 hours"&#x2014;<br>despite his numerous and humiliating infidelities.<br> At least I had my little pug with me, Gott sei dank! Tomorrow I <br>would stop speaking German forever, but not tonight. I could see where we <br>were headed and it was black as pitch.<br><br>Goosefoot<br><br>The approach to Versailles from the east is through forests of royal hunting <br>preserves&#x2014;the Bois de Boulogne, Saint-Cloud, home to wild pigs and guinea <br>fowl as well as the lesser forms of human life&#x2014;alternating with stretches of <br>open farmland. Here the wheat is grown that will be harvested in late summer <br>and ground into the loaves of bread that will be viewed with "mystical respect" <br>by the King of France himself.<br> The baker who bakes bread must do it properly, according to the <br>legal standard, which states that it shall be made of the best wheat on the <br>market or within two deniers of that price. And if it is found to be poorly baked <br>or too small in size, the baker shall pay a fine of five sols and the bread shall <br>be given to the <br>poor . . .<br> The sky is gray. It is raining. The approach to Versailles from the <br>east is through dense shadowy forests, the branches of the trees heavy and <br>wet and dripping, and behind every tree a wild animal, a cutpurse, a whore. <br>No wolves, though&#x2014;the wolves are all dead and gone, hunted out of <br>existence by Louis XIII, quite the hungry old wolf himself.<br> Over the Seine and onto the Avenue de Paris, the centermost <br>of the three tree-lined roads comprising the famous patte-d"oie, or goosefoot, <br>that converges at the palace gate. Rain is beading on the gold blade at the <br>tip of each of the gate"s gold rails, beading up and then streaming down to <br>pool darkly, muddily, on the ground. No matter how frugal the reigning <br>monarch, there never seems to be enough money. The fountains appear <br>broken, their basins clogged with debris, and in the gardens several statues <br>have fallen off their pedestals and are lying on their sides in the wet grass like <br>drunkards.<br> A dark morning and overcast, but on the approach to the chateau <br>no one has lit a single lantern.<br> The goosefoot was the idea of Le N�tre, the Sun King"s beloved <br>gardener; he wanted to impress on the landscape the same cross the <br>architect traces in the soil to indicate the main axes of a building. Versailles <br>is actually a little out of alignment. The brass meridian marker traverses the <br>Chamber of the Pendulum Clock diagonally rather than north to south, a fact <br>no one likes to talk about because solar symbolism is crucial to the King"s <br>sense of cosmic destiny. How happy it makes him to watch the sun rise <br>above his forecourt and set beneath his gardens! They extend on either side <br>of the Grand Canal, endlessly unrolling toward the western horizon, where <br>they at last slip through a gap between two poplars and plunge off the edge.<br> An unfortunate site for the seat of Bourbon power, really: a hillock <br>of unstable sand in the middle of a swamp in a wind tunnel of a valley.<br> Of course subsequent French theoreticians have embraced the <br>idea of Versailles"s misalignment, perhaps in the same spirit with which they <br>consider frog legs a culinary triumph.<br> It"s always better to make something out of nothing&#x2014;that"s the <br>French way.<br>And then the bed curtains part. How many nights? A thousand and one, give <br>or take a few?<br> Though instead of telling tales I scratch my husband"s flea bites, <br>the only itch he"ll let me scratch, poor thing. The bed curtains part and in he <br>comes, my very own King of France, just as he did that first night so many <br>years ago, his little eyes blinking uncontrollably in what I took to be a <br>colossal effort to see me in all my tender dishabille, though I now know he <br>was merely trying to stay awake. The sound of wind, of rain pattering onto <br>the leaves of the orange trees, and, even at so late an hour, feet racing up <br>and down the Stairways of the Hundred Steps.<br> Versailles in the spring&#x2014;beloved Versailles!&#x2014;frogs croaking deep <br>within the basins of her fountains, in the puddles left by the afternoon"s <br>storm. The anguished cry of a star-crossed lover, a few far-off rumbles of <br>thunder like dice flung across a gaming table. All the remembered sounds of <br>my earliest acquaintance with the place, but muffled, muffled, and then, for <br>the briefest fraction of an instant, vivid again . . .<br> It was my wedding night. I had just stepped out of my bridal gown <br>embroidered with white diamonds the size of hazelnuts. The bed curtains <br>parted and there was my new husband"s face, strangely bridelike itself in its <br>frame of white organdy and displaying the same slack-jawed expression I"d <br>noticed earlier that evening on his grandfather"s face, bored to death&#x2014;as any <br>sensible person would be&#x2014;by the endless hands of cavagnole and endless <br>trays of hors d"oeuvres, though without the old King"s dark catlike eyes, his <br>interest in female anatomy, my breasts in particular. The old King was <br>looking straight at them as he warned his grandson not to overeat and made <br>no effort to conceal his annoyance when Louis sagely observed that he <br>always slept better on a full stomach.<br> Which is probably why he chose to bring a plum tart with him into <br>the nuptial chamber, holding it tenderly on his palm like a pet. He took his <br>place on the right side of the bed and, without saying a word, began to cut <br>the tart into many tiny pieces with the same pocketknife I"d seen him use on <br>the Host. Singing off key, a song about the hunt, lalalalala, and then waving <br>the blade in my face, grudgingly, as if to suggest that if I were really hungry I <br>could scrape clean the knife&#x2014;no thank you!&#x2014;with my teeth.<br> A tall fellow, Louis, a regular hop-pole, narrowly built and long-<br>boned, though you could hardly tell since the lanky youth he might"ve been if <br>he hadn"t been forced to be King when all he really wanted was to draw maps <br>and forge locks had already gotten swaddled in layers and layers of flesh.<br> If he seemed sullen on our wedding night it wasn"t so much <br>because he didn"t want to share the tart with me. It wasn"t even the bed he <br>didn"t want to share. It was the life.<br> Sweet smell of orange blossoms mixed with other less <br>intoxicating smells, smoke in the wall hangings, shit in the hallways. Shit, <br>not excrement, for that is how I am, have always been and always will be&#x2014;I <br>adore the vernacular!<br> Lean close to a man and you can smell it on him, no matter how <br>diligently he strives to hide it. Lean close and you can also see a <br>constellation of flea bites on the delicate skin behind the ear, but try to kiss <br>him there&#x2014;just go ahead and try&#x2014;and he"ll brush your lips away like you"re <br>the flea.<br> Ma petite puce, I teased, practicing my French, and through <br>clenched teeth he replied, Laissez-moi, which I knew enough to know meant <br>Leave me alone. Not even a flicker of humor, or that widening of the wings of <br>the nostrils that, in my brother Karl at least, always meant he was <br>suppressing a laugh. I crooked a finger and began to scratch first one bite, <br>then another, until I had him moaning with pleasure. Louder, I prompted, <br>because of course I knew they were all there, the Queen"s Guard and a <br>thousand revelers, laughing and drinking and fornicating on the other side of <br>the Bull"s Eye window, waiting for some sign that the Dauphin wasn"t, to use <br>his grandfather"s phrase, a "laggard in the service of Aphrodite."<br> In those days I was also compared to Hebe, Psyche, Antiope, <br>Flora, and Minerva, though in the case of the last less due to her braininess <br>than the way she started life as one colossal headache.<br> Eventually I drew blood. Voil�! I said. Just a measly drop or two&#x2014;<br>but once the court laundresses spread the word, let the court gossips draw <br>their own conclusions.<br><br>Envelope<br><br>Twenty-eight by thirty-four toises. Thirty-two by forty. Invite carriages into the <br>courtyard. No! Keep the horses out . . .<br> It was an endearing quality of the Sun King that he couldn"t make <br>up his mind.<br> From the beginning, of course, he knew he wanted Versailles to <br>be the hub of the universe, and that the original chateau, a modest <br>brick "hunting lodge" built to provide his father with the ideal setting (i.e. as far <br>from his wife as possible) for post-hunt parties and amorous adventures, was <br>really much too small.<br> On this point Louis XIV and his advisors were in perfect accord: <br>the hub of the universe had to be a whole lot bigger. Where they hit a snag, <br>however, was in determining the limits of filial devotion: just because he was <br>Sun King, the advisors pointed out, didn"t mean his sentimentality should be <br>given free rein, particularly if it meant trying to find some way to cram his <br>father"s chateau into the heart of the new building like a "precious jewel," <br>rather than tear it down like the architectural catastrophe everyone agreed it <br>was. Tear it down? Louis roared. Am-poss-EEE-bluh! But to have to build <br>around the old chateau would be like building around a sinkhole in a bog, the <br>advisors whined.<br> It was May 1668. The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had just been <br>signed and, as usual after signing a treaty, the Sun King was filled with a <br>deep need either to start another war or begin building a monument to his <br>own brilliance. At such moments he couldn"t be stopped. Go ahead and try <br>tearing my father"s house down, he replied. As fast as you do, I"ll be <br>rebuilding it, brick by brick and stone by stone. At which point the advisors <br>gave up. Okay, they said. Keep the stupid house. Or words to that effect.<br> But when you insist on cleaving to the past, no matter how <br>enchanted your memory of it might be (through the window a round white <br>moon and a white spray of stars and swaying among the silver branches of <br>the lindens hundreds of yellow lanterns, and a beautiful woman with round <br>white breasts swinging to and fro on a golden swing, playing a lute and <br>singing, il y a longtemps que je t"aime, over and over, t"aime t"aime, as the <br>horses whinny and stamp their hooves on the marble paving stones and the <br>nightingales go chook chook chook . . .) you have to endlessly revise the <br>present to accommodate it.<br> Construction began in October; the following June the Kin...</p><h2>Rifts Sourcebook 4: Coalition Navy</h2><p>Welcome to Rifts Sourcebook 4: The Coalition Navy.

If it ceased flowing, the water held in its reservoirs might hold out for three to four years, but after that it would be necessary to abandon most of southern California and Arizona, and much of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. For the entire American Southwest the Colorado is indeed the river of life, which makes it all the more tragic and ironic that by the time it approaches its final destination, it has been reduced to a shadow upon the sand, its delta dry and deserted, its flow a toxic trickle seeping into the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this remarkable blend of history, science, and personal observation, acclaimed author Wade Davis tells the story of America&#x2019;s Nile, how it once flowed freely and how human intervention has left it near exhaustion, altering the water temperature, volume, local species, and shoreline of the river Theodore Roosevelt once urged us to &#x201c;leave it as it is.&#x201d; Yet despite a century of human interference, Davis writes, the splendor of the Colorado lives on in the river&#x2019;s remaining wild rapids, quiet pools, and sweeping canyons. The story of the Colorado River is the human quest for progress and its inevitable if unintended effects&#x2014;and an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and foster the rebirth of America&#x2019;s most iconic waterway.<br> &nbsp;<br> A beautifully told story of historical adventure and natural beauty, <i>River Notes</i> is a fascinating journey down the river and through mankind&#x2019;s complicated and destructive relationship with one of its greatest natural resources.</p><p>Wade Davis is Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society. An ethnographer, photographer, filmmaker, and writer, he is author of the international bestsellers <i>Into the Silence</i>, <i>Light at the Edge of the World, One River, The Serpent and the Rainbow, Shadows in the Sun</i>, and other books. His articles have appeared in <i>Outside, Cond� Nast Traveler, National Geographic, Scientific</i><i>American</i>, and many other publications."<i>River Notes</i> is both a love song and a paean of regret to America's most spectacular river. Wade Davis weaves his own story of running the river with history, geology and quotations from those who knew it in its free days. This is also a warning about how easy it is to lose America's precious landscape." <br> (<i>Denver Post</i>)<br><br>"Above all, the book&#x2015;by turns lyrical, elegiac and combative&#x2015;is a plea to save the Colorado River before it is too late." <br> (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"Often lyrically, Davis bemoans the state of a river that has been hemmed in so that cities including Las Vegas, San Diego, Los Angeles, Tucson and Phoenix can switch on their lights and have their taps flow....He does a good job of showing how we are all connected to this river, whether we recognize it or not." <br> (<i>The Washington Post</i>)<br><br>"[A] beautifully concise history of the Colorado River." <br> (<i>Men's Journal</i>)<br><br>"incisive analysis....If only all public discussion of America's accomplishments and short-comings could be so clear-eyed." <br> (<i>Canadian Geographic</i>)<br><br>"The Colorado, he notes in this compelling historical and environmental narrative, is now controlled by more than 25 dams as it supplies water and electric power to cities in the Southwest and West." <br> (<i>Dallas Morning News</i>)<br><br>"Davis manages to offer a distinct and compelling perspective on this iconic watercourse.

So it is in this Christian classic by the late pastor and evangelist A. W. Tozer. He brings the mystics to bear on modern spirituality, grieving the hustle and bustle and calling for a slow, steady gaze upon God. With prophetic vigor and flowing prose, he urges us to replace low thoughts of God with lofty ones, to quiet our lives so we can know God's presence. He reminds us that life apart from God is really no life at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Tozer writes from his knees, a posture fit for presenting the character of God in all its demanding grandeur. "Arise, O sleeper!" is his word to us, and yet if we heed the call, we will see that to arise is not to stand but to kneel before the God of heaven in humble contemplation. To pursue God is to know Him, and in our knowing, be drawn in.</p></p><h2>Game (The Good Cook)</h2><p>Learn to cook your game with great tastes.</p><p></p><h2>Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (Gift Edition with Scarab)</h2><p>In ancient Egypt, <i>The Book of the Dead</i> was buried with the deceased to assist the spirit in its journey to eternal life.

The places and periods I go to in my mind&#x2014;and I have no rational explanation for this&#x2014;are invariably set in big cities in the last century: San Francisco in the sixties, Paris in the fifties, London between the wars, Los Angeles in the thirties. And for the purposes of this introduction: the New York of the twenties. New York back in those days was the fizzy incubator of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties. It was the big room: Jimmy Walker was mayor; Wall Street and bootlegging were booming; jazz, modern art, and talkies were the rage; everyone&#x2014;from statesmen to sandhogs&#x2014;was trying to get their head around the latest theories of Freud and Einstein; and the bible for the smart set was <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p><p>It was <i>the</i> modern magazine during that early incarnation, from 1913 to 1936. And everybody, but everybody, wrote for it, including, in no particular order, P. G. Wodehouse, Alexander Woollcott, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T. S. Eliot, e. e. cummings, No�l Coward, Gertrude Stein, A. A. Milne, Stephen Leacock, Thomas Mann, Djuna Barnes, Bertrand Russell, Aldous Huxley, Langston Hughes, Sherwood Anderson, Walter Lippmann, Carl Sandburg, Theodore Dreiser, Colette, John Maynard Keynes, Ford Madox Ford, Clarence Darrow, Janet Flanner, Paul Gallico, Dalton Trumbo, William Saroyan, Thomas Wolfe, Walter Winchell, and Douglas Fairbanks (both Sr. and Jr.).</p><p>They were drawn to <i>Vanity Fair</i> by a decent word rate and by the magazine&#x2019;s editor, Frank Crowninshield. He was known as Crownie to his intimates, who recognized him for his skills as a cultural clairvoyant and a taste maker. He helped launch the seminal Armory Show in 1913, which introduced avant-garde painting to America, and was a founding trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. He would also play a significant role in the birth of what came to be known as caf� society, cohosting small get-togethers with Cond� Nast, the publisher of <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>Vogue.</i> Their parties brought together the era&#x2019;s brightest minds, talents, and wits, and were staged at the thirty-room penthouse apartment at 1040 Park Avenue that Crowninshield and Nast shared. (Same-sex domesticity was not uncommon back then.)</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>For twenty-two roller-coaster years, Crowninshield reveled in his singular cultural perch atop the masthead of what became the quintessential Jazz Age magazine. His <i>Vanity Fair</i> brimmed with groundbreaking photography and bold illustration and design. But just as important&#x2014;in ample evidence here&#x2014;were its sparkling essays, commentary, profiles, poetry, and fiction from many of the most forward-thinking writers of the day. Some contributors were public intellectuals (Huxley, Russell, H. L. Mencken). Others were experts in what was then experimental art and music (Clive Bell, Roger Fry, Gertrude Stein, George Jean Nathan, Virgil Thompson, Tristan Tzara, Carl Van Vechten). Still others, such as Fitzgerald, Anita Loos, John Emerson, and Donald Ogden Stewart, would go west to seek their fortune in the movie trade.</p><p>The offices of the magazine in those days&#x2014;first on fabled West Forty-fourth Street and later in the new Graybar Building, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal&#x2014;reflected its editor&#x2019;s eclectic tastes. Crowninshield, who had a soft spot for sleight of hand, kept a deck of cards ready for the amusement of staffers or for guests who would often pop in&#x2014;Harry Houdini, say, or Charlie Chaplin. Editorial lunches with his three rising staff members, Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert Sherwood, consisted of eggs Benedict, kippered herring, chocolate �clairs, and <i>caf� sp�cial.</i></p><p>According to Cond� Nast&#x2019;s biographer Caroline Seebohm, Crownie would run the office &#x201c;with the greatest informality. Actresses, models, photographers, and writers were always milling about in the reception room, under the impression that he had invited them to a personal interview. (He often had.)&#x201d; On many Saturday nights, Crowninshield could be found gambling in the basement of a brownstone on East Thirty-seventh Street, where friends like Woollcott would place wagers on tiny mechanical horses that would zip around a tabletop racetrack, the random victor determined by what they called a &#x201c;chance machine.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Crowninshield both sought and attracted excellence. The senior editors who would pass through <i>Vanity Fair</i>&#x2019;s doors were a storied lot: not only Parker, Benchley, and Sherwood, but also Edmund Wilson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Clare Boothe Brokaw, a brash, young dynamo who would eventually sleep her way through much of the masthead. (She also wrote the play <i>The Women,</i> married Henry Luce, and became a congresswoman and a U.S. ambassador to Italy.)</p><p>The magazine regularly predicted which cultural forces would leave a lasting mark. (To that end, I recommend the stories in this volume on Picasso, Chaplin, James Joyce, W. Somerset Maugham, Joan Crawford, Cole Porter, and Babe Ruth.) They took the pulse of the period&#x2014;in real time&#x2014;with an unrivaled sense of taste. The writing in <i>Vanity Fair</i> pushed boundaries with its muscular and often experimental prose. In examining the daunting shape of things to come, the magazine&#x2019;s writers wrote about men&#x2019;s rites and women&#x2019;s rights, the intrusive media and exclusive bastions of the well-to-do. They questioned our destructive fascination with the entertainment industry and our addiction to organized sports. They used satire to criticize ostentation, Prohibition, marital duplicity, and the grinding new &#x201c;publicity machine.&#x201d; Social historian Cleveland Amory would later observe that the magazine was &#x201c;as accurate a social barometer of its time as exists.&#x201d; The finest pieces in the Jazz Age <i>Vanity Fair, </i>seventy-two of which are collected here, focus more often than not on how Americans, especially New Yorkers, in confronting the Machine Age, radical art, urbanization, Communism, Fascism, globalization (epitomized by a World War), and the battle of the sexes, were coping with the growing pains of a new phenomenon: <i>modern</i> life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1910s</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIL</p><p>P. G. WODEHOUSE</p><p>FROM MAY 1914</p><p>Physical culture is in the air just now. Where, a few years ago, the average man sprang from bed to bath and from bath to breakfast-table, he now postpones his onslaught on the boiled egg for a matter of fifteen minutes. These fifteen minutes he devotes to a series of bendings and stretchings which in the course of time are guaranteed to turn him into a demi-god. The advertisement pages of the magazines are congested with portraits of stern-looking, semi-nude individuals with bulging muscles and fifty-inch chests, who urge the reader to write to them for an illustrated booklet. Weedy persons, hitherto in the Chippendale class, are developing all sort of unsuspected thews, and the moderately muscular citizen (provided he has written for and obtained the small illustrated booklet) begins to have grave doubts as to whether he will be able, if he goes on at this rate, to get the sleeves of his overcoat over his biceps.</p><p>To the superficial thinker this is all very splendid. The vapid and irreflective observer looks with approval on the growing band of village blacksmiths in our midst. But you and I, reader, shake our heads. We are uneasy. We go deeper into the matter, and we are not happy in our minds. We realize that all this physical improvement must have its effect on the soul.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>A man who does anything regularly is practically certain to become a bore. Man is by nature so irregular that, if he takes a cold bath every day or keeps a diary every day or does physical exercises every day, he is sure to be too proud of himself to keep quiet about it. He cannot help gloating over the weaker vessels who turn on the hot tap, forget to enter anything after January the fifth, and shirk the matutinal development of their sinews. He will drag the subject into any conversation in which he happens to be engaged. And especially is this so as regards physical culture.</p><p>The monotony of doing these exercises every morning is so appalling that it is practically an impossibility not to boast of having gone through with them. Many a man who has been completely reticent on the topic of his business successes and his social achievements has become a mere babbler after completing a month of physical culture without missing a day. It is the same spirit which led Vikings in the old days to burst into song when they had succeeded in cleaving some tough foeman to the chine.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Again, it is alleged by scientists that it is impossible for the physical culturist to keep himself from becoming hearty, especially at breakfast, in other words a pest. Take my own case. Once upon a time I was the most delightful person you ever met. I would totter in to breakfast of a morning with dull eyes, and sink wearily into a chair. There I would remain, silent and consequently inoffensive, the model breakfaster. No lively conversation from me. No quips. No cranks. No speeches beginning &#x201c;I see by the paper that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Nothing but silence, a soggy, soothing silence. If I wanted anything, I pointed. If spoken to, I grunted. You had to look at me to be sure that I was there. Those were the days when my nickname in the home was Little Sunshine.</p><p>Then one day some officious friend, who would not leave well alone, suggested that I should start those exercises which you see advertised everywhere. I weakly consented. I wrote for the small illustrated booklet. And now I am a different man. Little by little I have become just like that offensive young man you see in the advertisements of the give-you-new-life kind of medicines&#x2014;the young man who stands by the bedside of his sleepy friend, and says, &#x201c;What! Still in bed, old man! Why, I have been out with the hounds a good two hours. Nothing tires me since I tried Peabody and Finklestein&#x2019;s Liquid Radium.&#x201d; At breakfast I am hearty and talkative. Throughout the day I breeze about with my chest expanded, a nuisance to all whom I encounter. I slap backs. My handshake is like the bite of a horse.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, this has lost me a great many friends. But far worse has been the effect on my moral fiber. Before, I was modest. Now, I despise practically everybody except professional pugilists. I meet some great philosopher, and, instead of looking with reverence at his nobby forehead, I merely feel that, if he tried to touch his toes thirty times without bending his knees, he would be in the hospital for a week. An eminent divine is to me simply a man who would have a pretty thin time if he tried to lie on his back and wave his legs fifteen times in the air without stopping.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>There is another danger. I heard, or read, somewhere of a mild and inoffensive man to whom Nature, in her blind way, had given a wonderful right-hand punch. Whenever he got into an argument, he could not help feeling that there the punch was and it would be a pity to waste it. The knowledge that he possessed that superb hay-maker was a perpetual menace to him. He went through life a haunted man. Am I to become like him? Already, after doing these exercises for a few weeks, I have a waist-line of the consistency of fairly stale bread. In time it must infallibly become like iron. There is a rudimentary muscle growing behind my right shoulder-blade. It looks like an orange and is getting larger every day. About this time next year, I shall be a sort of human bomb. I will do my very best to control myself, but suppose a momentary irritation gets the better of me and I let myself go! It does not bear thinking of.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Brooding tensely over this state of things, I have, I think, hit on a remedy. What is required is a system of spiritual exercises which shall methodically develop the soul so that it keeps pace with the muscles and the self-esteem.</p><p>Let us say that you open with that exercise where you put your feet under the chest of drawers and sit up suddenly. Well, under my new system, instead of thinking of the effect of this maneuver on the abdominal muscles, you concentrate your mind on some such formula as, &#x201c;I must remember that I have not yet subscribed to the model farm for tuberculous cows.&#x201d;</p><p>Having completed this exercise, you stand erect and swing the arms from left to right and from right to left without moving the lower half of the body. As you do this, say to yourself, &#x201c;This, I know, is where I get the steel-and-indiarubber results on my deltoids, but I must not forget that there are hundreds of men whose confining work in the sweat shops has entirely deprived them of opportunities to contract eugenic marriages.&#x201d;</p><p>This treatment, you will find, induces a humble frame of mind admirably calculated to counterbalance the sinful pride engendered by your physical exercises.</p><p>Space forbids a complete list of these spiritual culture exercises, but I am now preparing a small illustrated booklet, particulars of which will be found in the advertising pages. An accompanying portrait shows me standing with my hands behind my head and with large, vulgar muscles standing out all over me. But there is a vast difference, which you will discover when you look at my face. I am not wearing the offensively preoccupied expression of most physical-culture advertisements. You will notice a rapt, seraphic expression in the eyes and a soft and spiritual suggestion of humility about the mouth.</p><p></p><p></p><p>AUGUST STRINDBERG</p><p>GEORG BRANDES</p><p>FROM OCTOBER 1914</p><p>Strindberg was the most brilliant author of modern Sweden, and one of the most gifted I have ever known. Ibsen, in speaking of him, once said: &#x201c;Here is a greater man than I.&#x201d;</p><p>But Strindberg was a wholly abnormal type, mentally. A man so eccentric that, except for his masterly writings, I should have called him insane.</p><p>But let me begin by saying a word as to his physical appearance! His strongly modeled forehead clashed strangely with the vulgarity of his lower features. The forehead reminded one of Jupiter&#x2019;s; the mouth and chin of a Stockholm street urchin. He looked as though he sprang from irreconcilable races. The upper part of his face was that of the mental aristocrat,&#x2014;the lower belonged to &#x201c;the servant girl&#x2019;s son,&#x201d; as he called himself in his autobiography.</p><p>During a long acquaintance with him I was fortunate in being able to agree with him on fundamental principles and to find that minor differences of opinion never irritated him against me, nor caused the slightest break between us.</p><p>It was my fate to be present at many crucial moments in Strindberg&#x2019;s mental life. More than once I have seen him on the turn-rail, as it were, which changed the entire direction of his spiritual and mental locomotive. And each time I have been able to remark how deep and sincere were his changes, even if they contained a trace of the theatrical in their outward expressions.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;...</p></p><h2>Alice in Bed: A Play</h2><p><p><i>Alice in Bed </i>is a free dramatic fantasy which merges the life of Alice James, the brilliant sister of William and Henry James, with the heroine of Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> It is a play about the anguish and grief and rage of women; and about the triumphs and limitations of the imagination.</p></p><p>Alice in Bed is a free dramatic fantasy based on the life of Alice James (1848-92), the brilliant sister of William and Henry James. The waters of depression closed over Alice James when she was nineteen; she tried to summon the courage to commit suicide, she suffered from a variety of vague and debilitating ailments, she went abroad, she stayed in bed, she kept a diary, and she died... at age forty-three. In Susan Sontag&#39;s play, Alice James merges imaginatively with the other great Alice of her period, the heroine of Lewis Carroll&#39;s Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland. A tea party is convened where Alice is counseled by Emily Dickinson and Margaret Fuller and by two exemplary angry women from the nineteenth-century stage: Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis (from Giselle), and Kundry (from Wagner&#39;s Parsifal), the guilt-ridden woman who wants to sleep. Alice in Bed is a play about the anguish and grief and rage of women, about mental traveling, about the triumphs and limitations of the imagination. It is a powerful and memorable addition to Susan Sontag&#39;s achievement as a writer.<p><b>Susan Sontag </b>was the author of four novels, including <i>In America</i>, which won the 2000 National Book Award for Fiction; a collection of stories; several plays; and seven works of nonfiction. She died in New York City on December 28, 2004.</p></p><h2>Homefront</h2><p><p><em>It never occurred to Phil Broker and Nina Pryce -- still recoveringfrom their life-and-death struggle with a demented terrorist -- that a minor school-yard tussle could lead to this.</em></p><p>In the winter backlands of Glacier Falls, Minnesota, nobody knows a thing about the crucial roles Broker and Nina played months earlier in averting an act of terrorism. Nor does anyone know about the damage -- both physical and psychological -- that Nina, especially, suffered as a consequence. This is why they'd moved here in the first place: for anonymity, calm, and therestorative powers of a remote landscape. Also for the chance, maybe, to become a family again. Broker tells himself that if they just keep a low profile, stay out of trouble, and tend to their wounds, everything will work out fine.</p><p>But it doesn't take much to set off an avalanche, and one is triggered for them when a school-yard bully picks a fight with the wrong third-grade girl: Phil and Nina's daughter, Kit. She humiliates Teddy Klumpe, and so too Klumpe's parents, by giving him a bloody nose -- and thereby puts the Broker household in the crosshairs of a vengeful local clan notorious for violenceand criminal behavior.</p><p>Suddenly little things start happening -- a flat tire, footprints in the snow, garbage spilled across the driveway. Did Broker leave the door unlocked? Or was somebody in the house when he and Kit were out cross-country skiing?</p><p>Broker copes as best as he can -- monitoring Nina's mood swings, running interference for Kit at school, and keeping a wary eye out for whoever's engaging in the small-time guerrilla warfare, which grows increasingly malevolent. When his daughter's kitten disappears, though, he begins to fear for his family's safety. But Glacier Falls' tiny police force is already stretched too thin, battling the scourge of methamphetaminethat has extended even to this rural outpost.</p><p>That's when the ghosts of Broker's past begin reappearing -- question is, to haunt or to help? The good news is that Harry Griffin, whom Broker served with in Vietnam thirty years earlier, advises him on how to deal with the locals -- and so an old friendship is reaffirmed.</p><p>But the bad news is really, really bad. An ex-con named Gator Bodine (another Klumpe relative) discovers Broker's role, long ago, in an undercover drug sting that resulted in the death of a mobster's son. Seeking advantage in his own criminal endeavors, he gives Broker up to the mobster, who dispatches a hit man to confirm that Gator's info is accurate -- and, if it is, toexact vengeance on Broker and his family.</p></p><p>Nina Pryce, one of a select few women attached to the Army's elite Delta Force, is on an extended medical leave, recovering from a firefight with a terrorist that claimed the lives of two teammates and left her badly injured. While her body has begun to heal, her psychic wounds are still raw; unable to care for her daughter, repair the damage to her marriage, or face the fact that her military career is over, she and her family take refuge in a remote Minnesota town. But trouble seems to follow in her wake, and what begins as a schoolyard fight between her daughter and a bullying classmate soon escalates into a terrifying standoff with a clan of backwoods methamphetamine "cookers" and a hitman bent on revenge against Nina's husband Phil Broker, a former undercover cop. Logan expertly balances the tough and the tender, as Broker attempts to nurse his wife back to health, protect eight-year-old Kit from the effects of her mother's post-traumatic depression, and guard those he loves from the legacy of his own violent past. Logan's solid pacing, strong narrative drive, and expert rendering of two complex characters whose unusual relationship is as fascinting as they are make this sixth title in an excellent series a standout guaranteed to keep the reader's attention riveted until the last page. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Chuck Logan is the author of eight novels, including <em>After the Rain</em>, <em>Vapor Trail</em>, <em>Absolute Zero</em>, and <em>The Big Law</em>.

I took a week off (I was still being fed by the&nbsp;<i>Express</i>) and got a super-saver to Albuquerque, rented a Vega and drove the hundred-odd miles south to Roswell.<br>It took me about ten minutes to fall in love with the town. Roswell is American perfect, a middle-sized city at peace with itself. It&#x2019;s an agricultural community with a smattering of light industry. The streets mix fifties modern with older architecture. Everywhere I went&#x2014;the motel, the radio and television stations, the local newspaper&#x2014;I was struck by the fact that this place was populated by decent people. Honest people.<br>At the Roswell&nbsp;<i>Daily Record</i>&nbsp;they were frank about the story. Everybody in town knew about it. The fact that something real had happened in July of 1947 and been covered up turned out to be an open secret across most of southern New Mexico.<br>Will tells me that I won&#x2019;t feel so much anger when I get older, but I felt anger now, interviewing people, walking the site of the crash near Maricopa, viewing the ruins of the old ranch on which the disk fell.<br>I was choked with bitterness. I&#x2019;d dismissed the whole UFO question with a laugh and I&#x2019;d been a&nbsp;<i>dupe!</i><br>My ego was involved and I thought I&#x2019;d never get over hating Will.<br>One of the most annoying things about him is how wise he is. He knew that I wouldn&#x2019;t always despise him.<br>I wish I could comfort that old man somehow, but he is beyond words, beyond touch, beyond everything.<br>South of Roswell stand the empty remains of the Roswell Army Air Field, now being transformed into an industrial park.<br>I walked that crooked tarmac on a warm spring day, and let the ghosts of the past rise up around me. There was no feeling of elegy or remembrance. I was angry, and the ghosts were angry, too.<br>At least two of those ghosts, and possibly a third, were not human. I wondered if they looked back also, and if they did not remember the night that they arrived, and died.<br>Through the ten o&#x2019;clock dark they came, silent and slow, watching the streets of Roswell unfold below them. More carefully they were watching the flight line, counting the planes, counting the bombs.<br>At that moment the 509th Strategic Bomber Wing stationed at Roswell was the only atomic bomber force in the world.<br>Perhaps they came to warn us, or perhaps theirs was a more subtle mission. But Roswell could not have been chosen by accident. Will explained to me that they have a definite tendency to appear right in the middle of our most sensitive, most dangerous, most heavily guarded military installations.<br>This was one of the things that caused the hostilities. &#x201c;Be as little children,&#x201d; Will says. Indeed, innocence does not know secrets and it does not know fear. But mankind is not the only earthly creation that fears death. Everything fears it. And when there is resurrection every living thing will be delivered, from the crawlers in the mud to the high bishops, and fear will be swept from the earth forever.<br>When&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;came, everything was afraid.<br>Birds awoke as they passed over, and fluttered nervously. Coons and bobcats screamed, opossums hissed. Babies shrieked in the night.<br>When they came it was midnight in Washington. Will Stone was a young man then, struggling to create a postwar career for himself in the Central Intelligence Group, soon to become the C.I.A. He knew nothing of what was happening in distant New Mexico.<br>His memory of what he was doing that night is nevertheless vivid. This shouldn&#x2019;t be surprising; we tend to recall exactly where we were at moments of great crisis.<br>A familiar wartime question: &#x201c;What were you doing when you heard about Pearl Harbor?&#x201d; Will Stone remembered: he was standing in a department store looking at some ties. &#x201c;Where were you when the Japs surrendered?&#x201d; He was drunk in Algiers.<br>What was he doing on the night of July 2, 1947?<br>He was lying in bed in his apartment worrying about the fact that he was having political problems at the office. Instead of working on the Russian desk he was off in a backwater, helping the Algerians put an end to French colonialism.<br>Betty and Sam White were sitting on their porch in Roswell sipping lemonade and watching the sky. It was a beautiful night, with storms off to the west and stars overhead.<br>I know just what they said, just how they acted. I&#x2019;ve read their files&#x2014;and all the other files that Will has&#x2014;many times over.<br>I&#x2019;ve tried and tried to see where Will and the others went wrong, to understand if there is anything in God&#x2019;s world that might help us now.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that,&#x201d; Sam asked his wife back on that lost night.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not real sure,&#x201d; she replied in her twangy voice.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna call the sheriff.&#x201d; He got up from his chair with a creak of porch boards and a grunt.<br>The object was round and brightly lit&#x2014;glowing, in fact. It made no sound as it swept northwestward across Roswell.<br>Beneath its thin blue light people went about their business. Except for the Whites, nobody noticed a thing.<br>At the Army Air Field the radar operators did not glance up from their glowing screens. The lookout on the tower was facing the other way, and never broke the imaginary monologue he was delivering to Dorothy Lamour.<br>Bob Ungar, on his ranch seventy miles northwest of Roswell, watched the storms with a critical and uneasy eye. He was totally unaware of what was approaching from the direction of town.<br>Bob&#x2019;s concern was the damned clouds.<br>They could drop hail as big as a sheep&#x2019;s eye. Hail like that could knot a man&#x2019;s skull or batter his animals until they were crazy. He&#x2019;d also found his share of sheep braised by lightning, lying stiff in the scrub.<br>The worst part was the way they&#x2019;d bunch up on the fences during a bad storm, frightened by the thunder and trying to shelter from the rain. You&#x2019;d find them in heaps, and the ones at the bottom would be smothered.<br>Bob pitied the poor, dumb things. I know he did, because I know exactly what kind of a man he was. I admire him unabashedly.<br>He died in the sixties, old and dried to straw by the desert.<br>Walking the path of Will Stone I spoke to Bob&#x2019;s wife, Ellie, now a very old woman. She lives in an adobe cottage&#x2014;really little more than a hut. Of course she&#x2019;s been wracked by time, but there is within her a light such as you don&#x2019;t often see. I spoke to her of her husband, and their old house that is in ruins now, and a long time ago.<br>I can imagine Bob standing on his back porch on that night, squinting into the dark west.<br>A long, cool gust swirled out of the dark. The air grew eerie. The last five nights he&#x2019;d saddled up his horse, Sadie, and gone out to help the sheep. It hadn&#x2019;t made a lick of difference. They&#x2019;d gotten themselves killed anyway.<br>You&#x2019;d think sheep had been going through thunderstorms for a long time. But this bunch, they got all worked up over a little sheet lightning, forget the thunder and wind and the hail.<br>He heard the sheep faintly, far off now, moaning and bleating.<br>Meanwhile the glowing object left the outskirts of Roswell and the Whites lost it in the darkness.<br>Cats that had leaped into bookshelves looked out. Dogs that had run under houses scrambled back to their masters&#x2019; sides. Babies that had been screaming began to sniffle and coo. Children sighed in their beds, their half-formed nightmares subsiding.<br>Lightning flared across the west, and the Ungars&#x2019; radio crackled. &#x201c;... tornado five miles south of Caprock...&#x201d; Then the static returned.<br>&#x201c;Oh, Lord,&#x201d; Bob said.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s way away from here.&#x201d; Ellie reached toward him, then withdrew her hand.<br>&#x201c;A hundred miles isn&#x2019;t nothin&#x2019;, not s&#x2019;far as these storms are concerned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get through,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I moved the sheep up that draw. They got a little shelter in there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I worry about the water comin&#x2019; down there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry now.&#x201d;<br>Some dance music came out of the radio. Fox-trot music.<br>&#x201c;Where is your gingham dress?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the cedar chest.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will you put it on for me?&#x201d;<br>She smiled the strong, accepting smile that he loved, and went into their bedroom. When she returned she was wearing the dress. She swayed to the music. He took his work-thin wife in his arms, and danced with her as the lightning flashes flickered.<br>&#x201c;Oh, Lordy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;do you remember the night we decided to get married? The conga line?&#x201d;<br>How they had danced! &#x201c;Old Joe really got that conga goin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bobby, I think that was the happiest dance of my life.&#x201d;<br>He closed his eyes and bent his head to her woman-smelling hair, and saw the black window float past.<br>At that moment there was a crack of thunder and the rising roar of wind. The radio was drowned out. He turned it off; no use in wasting the battery.<br>The wind came sweeping around the house, shaking the boards, screaming in the eaves, bringing with it the perfume of the range, sweet flowers, sage, dust. He imagined his animals out there in the storm. They&#x2019;d be milling, nervous, ready to stampede all the way to the wire if lightning struck nearby.<br>He wondered how it could help but strike them. Looking at it, he realized that he&#x2019;d never seen another storm quite like it, not in all of his years on this New Mexico land.<br>He doused the lamp. &#x201c;Ellie, come look.&#x201d;<br>They went out onto the porch together. The storm ...</p><h2>The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press Reference Library)</h2><p><p> An incomparable guide to the thousands of characters, from humble artisan to lofty genius, who people the unfolding history of music, this volume brings together all the pertinent biographical information about composers, performers, music theorists, and instrument makers from the days of praise chants to the bop and pop of today. A long-awaited companion to <i>The New Harvard Dictionary of Music</i>, and compiled with the same meticulous scholarship and delight in detail, this biographical dictionary emphasizes classical and art music, but also gives ample attention to jazz and blues, rock and pop, and hymns and showtunes across the ages--with unusual care devoted to coverage of the twentieth century. </p><p> </p><p> That the Belgian composer Jean Absil was professor of fugue at the Brussels Conservatory is a little-known fact.

The writings of the seventeenth-century organist Jakob Adlung may be obscure, while Theodor Adorno's are widely read and studied. But they can all be found in the A's, along with 218 more entries, from Herb Alpert and the Andrews Sisters to Carl Friedrich Abel and Emanuel Ax. And this is only the beginning. </p><p> </p><p> Here then is the information you need about 5500 figures in the world of music--the major, the minor, the famous, the nearly forgotten, from Bach and Beethoven to Irving Berlin, Benny Goodman, and Bruce Springsteen--capsule summaries of the lives and careers behind the music enjoyed in every era. The volume is enlivened with illustrations, some revelations in themselves. </p><p> </p><p> A compendium that no music lover should be without, this rich volume, along with <i>The New Harvard Dictionary of Music</i>, constitutes the standard reference work for the musically inclined, the curious, the informed, and the expert. </p></p><p>From Pietro Aaron to Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, Don Randel compiles 1,013 pages of thumbnail sketches describing the life and music of 5,500 individuals who figure significantly in the world of music.

Kidnapped centuries earlier and transformed into a red-tail hawk, Fiona is human once more and must learn how to be a modern woman. But damned if Trace is going to be the one to teach her. Not when her mere presence ignites a fiery passion deep within his cautious heart. <br><br>Fiona longs to overcome the painful memories of her tragic past&#x2014;to let down her guard and become a mother again. But so far her handsome landlord is not exactly thrilled with the stray animals&#x2014;and suitors&#x2014;that keep following her home. When the wizard Maximilian Oceanus shows up, Trace reaches the end of his rope. Weird things happen when Mac is around&#x2014;raging storms, snarling demons&#x2014;but this time, Midnight Bay is at the center of a fierce battle, and Fiona is the primary target. Only Trace can save her, but first, the lovers must set aside their fears . . . and open up their hearts.</p><p>A native of rural central Maine, Janet Chapman (1956&#x2013;2017) lived in a cozy log cabin on a lake with her husband, three cats, and a stay young bull moose. The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also wrote numerous contemporary romances.Mystical Warrior Chapter One<p></p> <br><br> <br>Trace Huntsman would have punched Kenzie Gregor in the face if the bastard hadn&#x2019;t looked too miserable to defend himself. So he hauled the highland warrior several yards down the driveway instead, out of earshot of the two women getting out of the large black SUV.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mind telling me what in hell is going on here?&#x201d; Trace asked through gritted teeth. &#x201c;And you damn well better start by explaining why the &#x2018;lost soul&#x2019; moving into my house just happens to be your sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;d told you I wanted the apartment for Fiona, would you have rented it to me?&#x201d; Kenzie asked, the determination in his eyes warring with his obvious guilt.<br> <br>Deciding that was a rhetorical question, Trace looked over his shoulder to see Eve Gregor wrap an arm around her sister-in-law and all but drag Fiona toward the outside stairs leading up to the second-floor apartment of his old New England farmhouse. He turned back to Kenzie. &#x201c;I offered to keep an eye on one of your displaced time travelers; I did not agree to babysit the little sister of a powerful dr�idh who will turn me into a toad if anything happens to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kenzie shot him a tight grin, although it did little to soften his expression. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as though we pulled your name out of a hat, Huntsman. Matt and I rented your apartment precisely so you can keep an eye on Fiona for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goddamn it, she&#x2019;s your sister, why can&#x2019;t you keep an eye on her? Better yet, why can&#x2019;t your brother? He&#x2019;s a wizard, for chrissakes; all he has to do is conjure up a protective bubble to put around her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do ye not think we wouldn&#x2019;t prefer to do just that?&#x201d; Kenzie asked softly. &#x201c;But what kind of life can she possibly have if we treat her like a child? Believe me; for as hard as this is on Fiona, it&#x2019;s sheer hell for Matt and me.&#x201d; Kenzie gestured toward the house. &#x201c;Which leaves us with you. It&#x2019;s our hope that by forcing Fiona to live on her own, she will eventually rediscover the strong, self-reliant woman she was before that bastard raped her and stole her courage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then build a house on your land and let her live under your watchful eye.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fiona needs to be in town in order to become part of this community. She must learn to trust people&#x2014;men in particular&#x2014;and that won&#x2019;t happen unless she realizes society is a blessing instead of a curse.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because Matt and I trust you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you and your brother are idiots. Hell, my own mother doesn&#x2019;t even trust me enough to water her plants and feed her cat when she goes out of town.&#x201d;<br> <br>Some of the tension eased out of Kenzie&#x2019;s shoulders, and this time his grin actually reached his eyes. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t need to water Fiona or feed her. In fact, Matt and I prefer you do nothing for her other than make sure she&#x2019;s safe. Her rent is paid up for the next six months, her cupboards will be stocked with a week&#x2019;s worth of food, and she has five hundred dollars in cash.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;When she gets hungry, she will have to walk to the store and buy what she needs, and when her money runs out, she&#x2019;ll have to find a job.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trace was incredulous. &#x201c;You expect a woman born in eleventh-century Scotland to just walk into a modern business and get a job?&#x201d; He snorted. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much call for washing clothes in the creek or spinning wool into yarn these days. No, wait,&#x201d; he said, snapping his fingers. &#x201c;Fiona was a red-tailed hawk for several centuries; maybe the town could hire her to control the pigeon population.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kenzie scowled. &#x201c;Fiona knows how to read and do numbers, and she can be quite resourceful when she&#x2019;s not jumping at shadows. Which is why you mustn&#x2019;t coddle her, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, sure. I&#x2019;ll just give you a call, then, when your dead sister&#x2019;s body starts stinking up my apartment.&#x201d;<br> <br>The towering highlander&#x2019;s grin returned, but quite menacing this time. &#x201c;Do not underestimate her, my friend, or it&#x2019;s likely your body I&#x2019;ll be carting off. Fiona may appear delicate, but I&#x2019;ve seen her go after a pack of wolves with only a stick when they tried to snatch one of our spring lambs. She was ten, and the wolves were smart enough never to return.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trace dropped his head in defeat. &#x201c;Goddamn it. I didn&#x2019;t sign up for this, Gregor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kenzie headed toward his SUV. &#x201c;Ye may wish to clean up your language around her,&#x201d; he said, his chuckle equally menacing. &#x201c;When she was eight, Fiona washed Matt&#x2019;s mouth out with soap for taking God&#x2019;s name in vain. But knowing she&#x2019;d never catch him in a footrace, she waited until he fell asleep that night and then shoved a lathered bar of soap halfway down his throat.&#x201d; He stopped and opened the rear hatch. &#x201c;So consider yourself warned. Fiona rarely gets mad, but she will get even.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trace grabbed one of the boxes out of the back of the truck and started toward the stairs. Great. Wonderful. Friggin&#x2019; fantastic. Why should he care if Matt Gregor turned him into a toad? Living under a rock waiting for a fly to land on his nose had to be better than babysitting an eleventh-century woman who had turned her fear of men into openly aggressive hatred.<br> <br>Which was a shame, really, considering that Fiona Gregor also happened to be stunningly beautiful. Dammit to hell, he&#x2019;d be beating two-legged wolves off with a stick once every bachelor within fifty miles realized a pretty new lamb had just moved into town.<br> <br>Trace suddenly stopped in mid-step. Wait a minute&#x2014;did that mean the Gregor brothers thought he was a goddamn eunuch?<br> <br>Well, Christ, they really were idiots if they had never considered they might have just conned the fox into guarding the henhouse.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Fiona squinted against the sunlight shooting through a knothole in the wood and slowly sat up as much as the sharply slanting ceiling allowed, giving a disheartened sigh. She made no apologies for hating men, but she surely was tired of being afraid of them. And she was quite disgusted with herself for going into a full-blown panic last night when Trace Huntsman had knocked on her door to tell her that electricity didn&#x2019;t grow on trees and that she needed to turn off the lights in her apartment.<br> <br>Afraid he might decide to push through the rickety old door and turn them off himself, she&#x2019;d run through the rooms like a madwoman, shutting off lamps and frantically searching for wall switches. She&#x2019;d turned off every last bulb, even though he&#x2019;d said she could leave one on just before he&#x2019;d walked back down the outside stairs.<br> <br>Thoroughly shaken by the late-night encounter, she had tried resorting to her old habit of sleeping in a closet, only to discover that all three of the apartment closets were simply too small. So she&#x2019;d dragged her blankets into the large cupboard built under the attic stairway, curled into a tight ball in the dark, and eventually fallen asleep.<br> <br>Blinking against the bright morning light when she opened the door, she decided to make a latch for the cupboard that she could lock from the inside. And before she started scrubbing every crack and crevice in the kitchen and bathroom, she should probably gather some of the sweetgrass she&#x2019;d seen growing down by the sea and make a mattress for it as well.<br> <br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be my permanent bed,&#x201d; she assured herself as she crawled out and stood up. &#x201c;But having a hidey-hole is only prudent, and there&#x2019;s no reason it can&#x2019;t be comfortable as well as secure.&#x201d; Maybe she could also disguise the fact that it even existed; some well-placed furniture and a large wall hanging over the door should do the trick.<br> <br>But her shoulders slumped as she stared down at the gaping cavity. A modern woman wouldn&#x2019;t have spent the night hiding in a cupboard&#x2014;even if she did live above a big, strong-looking, disgruntled landlord.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am well aware that electricity doesn&#x2019;t grow on trees,&#x201d; she muttered, walking to the bathroom. She stopped to look into the mirror over the sink and found gold-colored eyes exactly like her mother&#x2019;s glaring back at her. She began unbraiding her hair. &#x201c;Just because my brothers tricked you into renting this apartment to me, that&#x2019;s no reason for you to march up here in the middle of the night growling like an angry bear. You could have just called my cell phone and nicely asked me to turn off the lights. Or is acting civilized beyond the ken of modern warriors, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>Fiona decided it was beyond her ken how little men had changed in a thousand years, especially considering that technology had progressed out of this world&#x2014;literally! People had actually walked on the moon, yet every blasted man she&#x2019;d ever met&#x2014;in this century or in her old time&#x2014;was still a bully.<br> <br>Including her brothers.<br> <br>Fiona stripped out of the clothes she&#x2019;d slept in, then reached past the tattered shower curtain surrounding the bathtub and turned on the water. She felt bad for having spoken so bluntly to Eve yesterday, when her sister-in-law&#x2019;s feigned excitement had turned to horror the moment they&#x2019;d walked into the apartment. No, she probably shouldn&#x2019;t have said she considered this a rather nice prison compared with her last one, as Eve had grown even more appalled and started to go tell Kenzie the apartment wasn&#x2019;t fit for a dog to live in.<br> <br>Fiona had immediately stopped her, saying she&#x2019;d willingly live in a cave if her dear, sweet, loving brothers thought she should, seeing as how they seemed to know far better than she did what was good for her. And besides, with a little work, she could make the place quite cozy. She didn&#x2019;t have anything else to do now that they had each in turn banished her from their homes.<br> <br>Aye, she&#x2019;d definitely been too blunt, Fiona decided as she stepped under the hot spray of water. After making up her bed and unpacking some of the boxes they&#x2019;d spent last week filling with household goods, it had taken her almost two hours to persuade Eve&#x2014;who obviously felt guilty for siding with Kenzie&#x2014;that she was actually looking forward to putting her personal touch on her new home.<br> <br>Not that this old house could ever be as nice as her brothers&#x2019; homes, especially the veritable castle Matt and Winter were building up in the western mountains of Maine. And even though Kenzie and Eve lived in a century-old farmhouse similar to this one, theirs had just gone through a major renovation that had transformed it into a fortress the devil himself couldn&#x2019;t destroy.<br> <br>Whereas this place ... well, Fiona figured the roof was staying attached only by the grace of God, the furnishings and appliances were older than she was, and if the floors creaked any louder, she&#x2019;d likely be deaf in a month.<br> <br>On the plus side, however, it did have running water, indoor plumbing, and electricity that she happened to know came from power lines&#x2014;although she wasn&#x2019;t sure where the power in those lines actually came from.<br> <br>But just as soon as she worked up the nerve, she planned to visit the building full of books Eve&#x2019;s mother, Mabel, had told her about and find out for certain how electricity was made. And the next time Trace Huntsman felt the need to give her a lesson on modern technology, she intended to point out that she hadn&#x2019;t grown out of a tree.<br> <br>That is, assuming she could also work up the nerve to actually talk to the growling bear.</p><h2>Scrap Quilt Celebration: 24 Fantastic Projects from Quilters&#39; Best-Loved Patterns</h2><p>Quilters, here's a reason to celebrate!<br><br>We'll help you find a home for your fabric scraps-- in dozens of beautiful quilts.

Now she's preparing to open a permanent home for the retreats she leads, on a slice of breathtaking property on the Alabama coast owned by her mother-in-law. Make that <em>former mother-in-law</em>, a colorful eccentric who teaches Clare much about love and sacrifice and living freely. When Clare's marriage ends in tragedy, her work becomes the sole focus of her life. While Clare has no problem helping the hundreds of men and women who seek her advice to mend their broken hearts, healing her own is another matter entirely. Falling in love again is the last thing she wants.</p><p>So when Lex -- a charismatic, charming, burly sea captain -- moves to town to run the marina, Clare insists they remain friends and nothing more. But even though she fights it, she begins to fall for him -- and then finds she has a rival, his estranged wife Annalee.</p><p>A story infused with all the flavors, textures, and intrigues of a small Southern town, with a rich, resonant center, <em>Queen of Broken Hearts</em> is a bold step forward for Cassandra King.</p></p><p><strong>Cassandra King</strong> is the author of <em>Making Waves, The Sunday Wife, </em>and <em>The Same Sweet Girls</em>. A native of Lower Alabama, she lives in the Low Country of South Carolina with her husband, novelist Pat Conroy.A therapist specializing in helping people get sorted out postdivorce has her own problems of the heart in King's latest (after <i>The Same Sweet Girls</i>). Since the death of her husband, "divorce coach" Clare has thrown herself into her work. And now that she has a booming practice on Alabama's gulf coast, her after-hours is packed with even more drama: her best friend Dory's marriage is forever on the rocks; her daughter Haley's husband abandons the family; Maine transplant and marina owner Lex is newly divorced, available and interested; and Zoe, Clare's dead husband's mother, is helping Clare accomplish her dream of creating a retreat center. With more than a little help from her friends&#x2014;old and new&#x2014;Clare lets go of her grief and gives love another shot. Though it exhibits that unmistakable Southern charm, King's writing also frustrates: backstories are hinted at but left murky, while nagging questions hang around for hundreds of pages (the circumstances surrounding Clare's husband's death, for instance) and overshadow Clare's present-day narrative. Storytelling kinks aside, King delivers what her fans want&#x2014;strong bonds, strong women characters and triumph over tragedy. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jericho's own struggles include nerve-wracking mental labor, the mysterious disappearance of a former girlfriend, the suspicions of his co-workers within the paranoid high-security project, and the certainty that someone close to him, perhaps the missing girl, is a Nazi spy. The plot is pure fiction but the historical background, Alan Turing's famous wartime computing project that cracked the German U-boat communications code, is real and accurately portrayed. Enigma is convincingly plotted, forcefully written, and filled with well drawn characters; in short, it's everything a good technomystery should be."LITERATE AND SAVVY . . .

In the 1600s, Lady Castlehaven charged her husband with rape and had his connubial rights--and head--removed. Prioress Eglentyne, who appears in Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales,</i> fell afoul of clerical colleagues by ignoring rules about "dress, dogs, dances" and worse yet, "wandering in the world." And let's not forget Isabel, Queen of Castile, patron of Columbus, and wife to Ferdinand. Her marriage motto was "They rule with equal rights and both excel, Isabel as much as Ferdinand, Ferdinand as much as Isabel."Historian Leon provides a lively history of a middle ages period filled not with homemakers and princes; but with feisty women who defied cultural expectations and built powerful lives.

Nicholas Barber is a 23-year-old monk who, fearing the wrath of his bishop for breaking his vows of chastity, takes up with a troupe of traveling players. Coming to a small town in the middle of winter, the troupe puts on its usual morality play, only to get caught up in a drama of a different kind.

He is the author of bestsellers such as In the Name of Jesus and Life of the Beloved (both with Crossroad) and has taught at the University of Notre Dame, Yale and Harvard.Nouwen's unexpected death in 1996 ended the prolific writing career of the Dutch Catholic priest who bridged denominational chasms between Christians everywhere. Since then, the Henri Nouwen Literary Centre in Canada has seen that two of Nouwen's unfinished books have been published and has continued to plumb his collection of unpublished papers, manuscripts, letters, tapes and videos for other possibilities. This brief collection is part of that effort. It comprises three previously published Nouwen essays, "The Path of Power," "The Path of Peace" and "The Path of Waiting," and adds a fourth, "The Path of Living and Dying." Based on a talk Nouwen gave at the National Catholic HIV/AIDS Conference in Chicago and an interview with Crosspoint magazine, this last essay is of particular interest as it opens a window to Nouwen's own preparation for his passage into the life he believed awaited him after death. Although Sue Mosteller, literary executrix of the Nouwen Literary Centre, molded Nouwen's thoughts into this essay, her choice and arrangement of words are true to the man's spirit in their frankness and ability to distill a subject's essence. Those familiar with Nouwen's writings will doubtless agree that he could easily have written passages like this: "Death in itself is not wonderful. It is terrible. But how we see our death and the death of others we know and love can be transforming. It takes time. But it is possible." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>To the Power of Three</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Powerful....A gripping tale that is a mystery only in the same sense as <em>To Kill a Mockingbird </em>was....Brilliant, insightful, moving.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em></p><p>There are excellent reasons why <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Laura Lippman has won the Edgar�, Agatha, Anthony, Nero Wolfe, and every other major award the mystery genre has to offer. <em>To the Power of Three</em> is just one of those reasons.

Visit her website at JodiPicoult.com.Plain Truth <br>ONE<br> <br>She had often dreamed of her little sister floating dead beneath the surface of the ice, but tonight, for the first time, she envisioned Hannah clawing to get out. She could see Hannah&#x2019;s eyes, wide and milky; could feel Hannah&#x2019;s nails scraping. Then, with a start, she woke. It was not winter&#x2014;it was July. There was no ice beneath her palms, just the tangled sheets of her bed. But once again, there was someone on the other side, fighting to be free.<br> <br>As the fist in her belly pulled tighter, she bit her bottom lip. Ignoring the pain that rippled and receded, she tiptoed barefoot into the night.<br> <br>The barn cat yowled when she stepped inside. She was panting by now, her legs shaking like willow twigs. Lowering herself to the hay in the far corner of the calving pen, she drew up her knees. The swollen cows rolled their blue moon eyes in her direction, then turned away quickly, as if they knew better than to bear witness.<br> <br>She concentrated on the hides of the Holsteins until their black spots shimmied and swam. She sank her teeth into the rolled hem of her nightgown. There was a funnel of pressure, as if she were being turned inside out; and she remembered how she and Hannah used to squeeze through the hole in the barbed wire fence by the creek&#x2019;s edge, pushing and angled, all knees and grunts and elbows, until by some miracle they&#x2019;d tumble through.<br> <br>It was over as suddenly as it had begun. And lying on the matted, stained hay between her legs was a baby.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Aaron Fisher rolled over beneath the bright quilt to stare at the clock beside the bed. There had been nothing, no sound to wake him, but after forty-five years of farming and milking, the smallest things could pull him out of sleep: a footfall in the corn, a change in the pattern of the wind, the rasp of a mother&#x2019;s tongue roughing a newborn calf.<br> <br>He felt the mattress give as Sarah came up on an elbow behind him, the long braid of her hair curling over her shoulder like a seaman&#x2019;s rope. &#x201c;Was ist letz?&#x201d; What&#x2019;s the matter?<br> <br>It was not the animals; there was a full month before the first cow was due to deliver. It was not a robber; there was too little noise. He felt his wife&#x2019;s arm slip around him, hugging his back to her front. &#x201c;Nix,&#x201d; he murmured. Nothing. But he did not know if he was trying to convince Sarah, or himself.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>She knew enough to cut the cord that spiraled purple to the baby&#x2019;s belly. Hands shaking, she managed to reach the old scissors that hung on a peg near the pen&#x2019;s door. They were rusty and coated with bits of hay. The cord severed in two thick snips, and then began spurting blood. Horrified, she pressed her fingers to the ends, pinching it shut, wildly looking around for something to tie it off.<br> <br>She rummaged in the hay and came up with a small length of baling twine, which she quickly tied around the cord. The bleeding slowed, then stopped. Relieved, she sank back on her elbows&#x2014;and then the newborn started to cry.<br> <br>She snatched the baby up and rocked it tightly. With her foot, she kicked at the hay, trying to cover the blood with a clean layer. The baby&#x2019;s mouth opened and closed on the cotton of her nightgown, rooting.<br> <br>She knew what the baby wanted, needed, but she couldn&#x2019;t do it. It would make this real.<br> <br>So she gave the baby her pinkie finger instead. She let the small, powerful jaws suckle, while she did what she had been taught to do in times of extreme stress; what she had been doing for months now. &#x201c;Lord,&#x201d; she prayed, &#x201c;please make this go away.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The rustle of chains awakened her. It was still dark out, but the dairy cows&#x2019; internal schedule had them rising at their individual stalls, their bags hanging blue-veined and round with milk, like full moons caught between their legs. She was sore and tired, but knew she had to get out of the barn before the men arrived to do the milking. Glancing down, she realized that a miracle had come to pass: the blood-soaked hay was fresh now, except for a small stain beneath her own bottom. And the two things she&#x2019;d been holding when she fell asleep&#x2014;the scissors and the newborn&#x2014;were gone.<br> <br>She pulled herself to her feet and glanced toward the roof, awed and reverent. &#x201c;Denke,&#x201d; she whispered, and then she ran out of the barn into the shadows.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Like all other sixteen-year-old Amish boys, Levi Esch no longer attended school. He&#x2019;d gone through the eighth grade and was now in that limbo between being a child and being old enough to be baptized into the Amish faith. In the interim, he was a hired hand for Aaron Fisher, who no longer had a son to help him work his dairy farm. Levi had gotten the job through the recommendation of his older cousin Samuel, who&#x2019;d been apprenticing with the Fishers now for five years. And since everyone knew that Samuel was probably going to marry the Fishers&#x2019; daughter soon and set up his own farm, it meant Levi would be getting a promotion.<br> <br>His workday started at 4:00 A.M., as on all other dairy farms. It was still pitch-dark, and Levi could not see Samuel&#x2019;s buggy approach, but he could hear the faint jingle of tack and traces. He grabbed his flat-brimmed straw hat and ran out the door, then jumped onto the seat beside Samuel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; he said breathlessly.<br> <br>Samuel nodded at him but didn&#x2019;t turn, didn&#x2019;t speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; Levi teased. &#x201c;Katie wouldn&#x2019;t kiss you good-bye last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>Samuel scowled and cuffed Levi, sending his hat spinning into the back of the buggy. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you just shut up?&#x201d; The wind whispered at the ragged edge of the cornfield as they drove on in silence. After a while, Samuel pulled the buggy into the Fishers&#x2019; front yard. Levi scuffed the toe of his boot into the soft earth and waited for Samuel to put the horse out to pasture before they headed into the barn.<br> <br>The lights used for milking were powered by a generator, as were the vacuum pumps hooked up to the teats of the cows. Aaron Fisher knelt beside one of the herd, spraying the udders with iodine solution and then wiping them dry with a page ripped from an old phone book. &#x201c;Samuel, Levi,&#x201d; he greeted.<br> <br>He did not tell them what to do, because by now they already knew. Samuel maneuvered the wheelbarrow beneath a silo and began to mix the feed. Levi shoveled out the manure behind each cow, periodically looking at Samuel and wishing he was already the senior farmhand.<br> <br>The barn door opened, and Aaron&#x2019;s father ambled in. Elam Fisher lived in the grossdawdi haus, a small apartment attached to the main building. Although Elam helped out with the milking, Levi knew the unwritten rules: make sure the old man carried nothing heavy; keep him from taxing himself; and make him believe that Aaron couldn&#x2019;t do without him, although Aaron could have, any day of the week. &#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; Elam boomed, then stopped in his tracks, his nose wrinkled above his long, white beard. &#x201c;Why, we&#x2019;ve had a calf.&#x201d;<br> <br>Puzzled, Aaron stood. &#x201c;No. I checked the pen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elam shook his head. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the smell of it, all the same.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More like it&#x2019;s Levi, needing a bath,&#x201d; Samuel joked, emptying a fresh scoop of feed in front of the first cow.<br> <br>As Samuel passed him with the wheelbarrow, Levi came up swinging and slipped on a slick of manure. He landed on his bottom in the ditch built to catch the refuse and set his jaw at Samuel&#x2019;s burst of laughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on now,&#x201d; Aaron chided, although a grin tugged at his mouth. &#x201c;Samuel, leave him be. Levi, I think Sarah left your spare clothes in the tack room.&#x201d;<br> <br>Levi scrambled to his feet, his cheeks burning. He walked past Aaron, past the chalkboard with the annotated statistics on the cows due to calve, and turned into the small cubby that housed the blankets and bridles used for the farm&#x2019;s workhorses and mules. Like the rest of the barn, it was neat as a pin. Braided leather reins crossed the wall like spiderwebs, and shelves were stacked with spare horseshoes and jars of liniment.<br> <br>Levi glanced about but could see no clothing. Then he noticed something bright in the pile of horse blankets. Well, that would make sense. If Sarah Fisher had washed his things, they had probably been done with the other laundry. He lifted the heavy, striped blanket and recognized his spare trousers and jewel green shirt, rolled into a ball. Levi stepped forward, intending to shake it out, and found himself staring down into the tiny, still face of a newborn.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaron!&#x201d; Levi skidded to a stop, panting. &#x201c;Aaron, you&#x2019;ve got to come.&#x201d; He ran toward the tack room. Aaron exchanged a glance with his father, and they both started after the boy, with Samuel trailing.<br> <br>Levi stood in front of a stool piled high with horse blankets, on top of which rested a sleeping baby wrapped in a boy&#x2019;s shirt. &#x201c;I . . . I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s breathing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Aaron stepped closer. It had been a long time since he&#x2019;d been around a baby this small. The soft skin of its face was cold. He knelt and tipped his head, hoping that its breath would fall into the cup of his ear. He flattened his hand against its chest.<br> <br>Then he turned to Levi. &#x201c;Run to the Schuylers and ask to borrow their phone,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Call the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Get out,&#x201d; Lizzie Munro said to the officer in charge. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to check an unresponsive infant. Send an ambulance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re already there. They want a detective.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lizzie rolled her eyes. Every year that she&#x2019;d been a detective-sergeant with the East Paradise Township police, the paramedics seemed to get younger. And more stupid. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a medical call, Frank.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, something&#x2019;s out of kilter down there.&#x201d; The lieutenant handed her a slip of paper with an address on it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fisher?&#x201d; Lizzie read, frowning at the surname and the street. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re Amish?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lizzie sighed and grabbed her big black purse and her badge. &#x201c;You know this is a waste of time.&#x201d; In the past, Lizzie had occasionally dealt with Old Order Amish teenagers, who&#x2019;d gather together in some guy&#x2019;s barn to drink and dance and generally disturb the peace. Once or twice she&#x2019;d been called to take a statement from an Amish businessman who&#x2019;d been burglarized. But for the most part, the Amish had little contact with the police. Their community existed unobtrusively within the regular world, like a small air bubble impervious to the fluid around it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just take their statements, and I&#x2019;ll make it up to you.&#x201d; Frank held the door open for her as she left her office. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find a nice, fat felony for you to sink your teeth into.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do me any favors,&#x201d; Lizzie said, but she was grinning as she got into her car and headed to the Fisher farm.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The Fishers&#x2019; front yard was crowded with a squad car, an ambulance, and a buggy. Lizzie walked up to the house and knocked on the front door.<br> <br>No one answered, but a voice behind Lizzie called out a greeting, the cadences of the woman&#x2019;s dialect softening her consonants. A middle-aged Amish woman wearing a lavender dress and a black apron hurried toward Lizzie. &#x201c;I am Sarah Fisher. Can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Detective-Sergeant Lizzie Munro.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sarah nodded solemnly and led Lizzie into the barn&#x2019;s tack room, where two paramedics knelt over a baby. Lizzie hunkered down beside one EMT. &#x201c;What have you got?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Newborn, emphasis on the new. No pulse or respirations when we got here, and we haven&#x2019;t been able to revive him. One of the farmworkers found him wrapped up in that green shirt, underneath a horse blanket. Can&#x2019;t tell if it was stillborn or not, but someone was trying to hide the body all the same. I think one of your guys is around by the milking stalls, he might be able to tell you more.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a second&#x2014;someone gave birth to this baby, and then tried to conceal it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. About three hours ago,&#x201d; the paramedic murmured.<br> <br>Suddenly the simple medical response call was more complicated than Lizzie had expected, and the most likely suspect was standing four feet away. Lizzie glanced up at Sarah Fisher, who wrapped her arms around herself and shivered. &#x201c;The baby . . . it&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so, Mrs. Fisher.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lizzie opened her mouth to ask another question, but was distracted by the distant sound of equipment being moved about. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The men, finishing up the milking.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lizzie&#x2019;s brows shot up. &#x201c;The milking?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;These things . . .&#x201d; the woman said quietly. &#x201c;They still have to be done.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly, Lizzie felt profoundly sorry for her. Life never stopped for death; she should know that better than most. She gentled her voice and put her hand on Mrs. Fisher&#x2019;s shoulder, not quite certain what sort of psychological state the woman was in. &#x201c;I know this must be very difficult for you, but I&#x2019;m going to have to ask you some questions about your baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sarah Fisher raised her eyes to meet Lizzie&#x2019;s. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my baby,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have no idea where it came from.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>A half hour later, Lizzie leaned down beside the crime scene photographer. &#x201c;Stick to the barn. The Amish don&#x2019;t like having their pictures taken.&#x201d; The man nodded, shooting a roll around the tack room, with several close-ups of the infant&#x2019;s corpse.<br> <br>At least now she understood why she&#x2019;d been called down. An unidentified dead infant, an unknown mother who&#x2019;d abandoned it. And all this smack in the middle of an Amish farm.<br> <br>She had interviewed the neighbors, a Lutheran couple who swore that they&#x2019;d never heard so much as raised voices from the Fishers, and who couldn&#x2019;t imagine where the baby might have come from. They had two teenage daughters, one of whom sported a nose and navel ring, who had alibis for the previous night. But they had agreed to undergo gynecological exams to rule themselves out as suspects.<br> <br>Sarah Fisher, on the other hand, had not.<br> <br>Lizzie considered this as she stood in the milk room, watching Aaron Fisher empty a small hand tank of milk into a larger one. He was tall and dark, his arms thick with ropes of muscle developed by farming. His beard brushed the second button of his shirt.

Kuhn is now a Washington lobbyist.Kuhn first met Reagan in 1975, when Kuhn was a 23-year-old Ohio farm kid who had voted for McGovern in 1972. Kuhn had been recruited to work for a Republican candidate during the 1974 primaries and made a "surprisingly easy" switch: "I found that I was attracted more to a particular candidate than to a particular ideology." Working the next year for Reagan, then governor of California, as a campaign "advance man" (prepping rally sites), Kuhn traveled with Reagan as he challenged Ford for the 1976 presidential nomination and returned for the successful 1980 campaign ("a spiritual and moral crusade to revive the heart of America"). After four years as a presidential appearance advance man (Kuhn was elsewhere during the assassination attempt), he became Reagan's executive assistant in 1984. Kuhn's admiring anecdotes about Reagan's interpersonal interactions form the heart of the book. Reagan's reactions to Reykjavik, Iran-Contra and myriad other '80s events are also here, and unfailingly admired by Kuhn. Light and light-filled, Kuhn's version of morning in America gives tender and specific recollections of its glossy surfaces, but not much more. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then traveled on foot through Spain as described in <i>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</i>. He married Catherine Polge and had one daughter; he died in 1997.Originally published in 1969, Lee's charming account of his travels in Spain in 1935 became almost as popular as his delightful Cider with Rosie. This fussily illustrated edition is an insult to an enjoyable prose work by a distinguished poet. Rather than eliciting the Spain that Lee visited, these old-fashioned illustrations from a variety of sources detract from a text that is rendered unreadable by a 34-pica measure, surmounted by running headlines (finically set in caps and italic initial caps), topped by a double line that serves as "walking" surface for a little man with stick (presumably representing the author) who promenades remorselessly across the page, pica by pica, as the reader progresses with the story. Each color illustration is surrounded by a white mat-like area enclosed, in turn, by a triple-rule frame set against a tan backgrounda tacky effect.

Solomon and Etta Ellen were married McBride, Montcalm County, Michigan. Solomon resided in Chicago, llinois for a time before taking up his principal residence in Grand Rapids, Michigan. During the period 1877 to 1901, much controversy erupted in Protestant Christianity over the matter of &#39;holiness&#39; movements. Solomon Benjamin Shaw as editor of theMichigan Holiness Record, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, attended conventions trying to deal with the subject, convened in Cincinnati and New York (1877); Jacksonville, Illinois (1880); Round Lake, New York (1882); Chicago 1885; and again in Chicago in 1901. Rev. Shaw labored on what he referred to as the &#34;undenominational line&#34;. This stand constituted a middle ground between the association plan favored by the denomination-oriented members of the National and the independent congregationalists of the movement. &#34;Our work is not to build up or tear down churches, but to save souls and to lead God&#39;s people into the glorious experience of entire sanctification regardless of denominational lines,&#34; he said.Among the books that document the Welsh revival of 1904-05, S. B. Shaw s The Great Revival in Wales is one of the best I ve seen. Originally published in 1905, the books has been reproduced and slightly edited by Larry Martin and Christian Life Books of Pensacola, Florida. What sets this work apart from other books about the revival is its immediacy. Made up of then contemporary news reports, it captures the real flavor of the meetings that caused nationwide interest in Britain and beyond. Thirty-four thousand conversions in Wales proclaims one chapter, and Remarkable scene in a coal mine, says another. Reports on the spontaneous music, passionate prayers, and heartfelt testimonial meetings that lasted into the early morning hours fill these interesting pages. Historic photos also give faces to names that are well known from the past--among them those of Welsh revival leader Evan Roberts and General William Booth of the Salvation Army. Readers who are interested in the nature and origin of spiritual revivals will find this book a valuable primary resource on the subject. --Amazon.com<br><br>If you're longing for revival, you should read this book.

It is now being reissued in paperback from to satisfy the continuing demand for copies of the book. In brief, the subject of von Rad&#39;s study of Hebrew wisdom is Israel&#39;s willingness to ground faith in encounter with the world as the creation of God. Those familiar with the author&#39;s Old Testament Theology will recall how he identified two great watersheds in the history of Israel&#39;s thought. The first was the rise of the prophetic movement, which occasioned a radical reinterpretation of Israel&#39;s religious traditions as expressed in the earliest creedal formulations found in the Pentateuch. The second watershed, which preceded the prophetic movement and was a basically different assessment of Israel&#39;s relation to Yahweh, was achieved by wisdom teachers at the start of the monarchy. This book studies this first and somewhat novel break with Israel&#39;s older sacral traditions. Von Rad bases the study on a wide range of literary materials principally concerned with the books of Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, and the Wisdom of Ben Sirach. No finer introduction to the fundamental theological questions raised by the wisdom literature of Israel is available.

He vividly conjures Scholem&#x2019;s upbringing in Berlin, and compellingly brings to life Scholem&#x2019;s transformative friendship with Walter Benjamin, the critic and philosopher. In doing so, he reveals how Scholem&#x2019;s frustration with the bourgeois ideology of Germany during the First World War led him to discover Judaism, Kabbalah, and finally Zionism, as potent counter-forces to Europe&#x2019;s suicidal nationalism. <br> &nbsp;<br> Prochnik&#x2019;s own years in the Holy Land in the 1990s brings him to question the stereotypical intellectual and theological constructs of Jerusalem, and to rediscover the city as a physical place, rife with the unruliness and fecundity of nature. Prochnik ultimately suggests that a new form of ecological pluralism must now inherit the historically energizing role once played by Kabbalah and Zionism in Jewish thought.</p><p>George Prochnik&#x2019;s most recent book, <i>The Impossible Exile: Stefan Zweig at the End of the World</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>received the National Jewish Book Award for Biography/Memoir in 2014 and was shortlisted for the Wingate Prize in the UK.

And yet many people haven&#x2019;t heard of him. George Prochnik aims to change this with his book 'Stranger in a Strange Land: Searching for Gershom Scholem and Jerusalem.' Prochnik is the author of several books, most recently &#x2018;The Impossible Exile: Stefan Zweig at the End of the World,&#x2019; which won the National Jewish Book Award in 2014. In &#x2018;Stranger in a Strange Land,&#x2019; he again mixes biography and memoir, digging deep into Scholem&#x2019;s life and work while telling the story of his own relationship with Judaism and Jerusalem, the adopted city of both author and subject....[using] a colorful style...But it&#x2019;s the way Prochnik weaves memoir through this intellectual biography that shows how thoroughly the author&#x2019;s own life has twined with Scholem&#x2019;s ideas. Just as a mystic ascends from one palace to the next in Kabbalah cosmology, Scholem&#x2019;s life and work have led Prochnik from phase to phase of his own.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>WASHINGTON POST</i></b><br><br>"Stranger in a Strange Land<i>, by George Prochnik (Other)</i>. Gershom Scholem, the renowned historian and theologian, was instrumental in the formation of twentieth-century Zionism and played a crucial role in revitalizing Jewish mysticism. He was also a fractious man of &#x201c;unrepentant multiplicity,&#x201d; and once fancied himself the Messiah. Entwining memoir with biography, Prochnik skillfully chronicles Scholem&#x2019;s intellectual and personal life, including his passionate friendship with Walter Benjamin; his 1923 emigration from Berlin to Jerusalem; and his ambivalent attitude toward the evolution of Zionism, which eventually, he believed, &#x201c;triumphed itself to death.&#x201d; Prochnik&#x2019;s account of his own sojourn in Jerusalem illuminates the ongoing struggle to reconcile Zionist ideals with political realities and to envision possibilities for breaking &#x201c;the spell of hopelessness&#x201d; in a divided land." <b>&#x2014;<i>NEW YORKER</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Prochnik (<i>The Impossible Exile</i>) effectively and movingly combines a nuanced biography of Gershom Scholem, who &#x2018;singlehandedly created an academic discipline [Jewish Mysticism] out of an obscure theological tradition [study of the Kabbalah],&#x2019; with a warts-and-all autobiography that recounts Prochnik&#x2019;s search for meaning in his own life...This is a powerful must-read for anyone interested in how people of faith struggle to live in the real world.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2014;PUBLISHERS WEEKLY STARRED REVIEW<br><br></i></b>"...George Prochnik has produced a book of remarkable erudition and emotional depth that plays the life and thinking of Gershom Scholem against his own.

Like Scholem, Prochnik (The Impossible Exile, 2014) has repeatedly been engaged in an intellectual and spiritual quest, searching for a balance between the physical and the ethereal and touching on the nature of Jewish identity. Prochnik alternates between his own experiences living in Israel in the 1990s and Scholem&#x2019;s life and intellectual evolution in the emerging Zionist state. Along with his deep emotional attachment to Israel, Prochnik was troubled by the dehumanizing aspects of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Scholem, born in Berlin, was a cultural rather than a political Zionist. He hoped for a binational state in Palestine, an idealistic aspiration frustrated by both Jewish and Arab nationalism...a stimulating examination of the struggles of both men to reconcile their idealism with reality.&#x201d;<b><i> <b><i>&#x2014;BOOKLIST</i></b><br><br></i></b>&#x201c;On this spiritual journey, writer Prochnik...traces the intellectual and mystical arc of Gershom Scholem, the German-born Israeli philosopher who advanced theories of Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism...complex and intricate...for readers drawn to Jewish mysticism and Jewish messianism and those interested in Prochnik&#x2019;s peregrinations in the footsteps of Scholem, Sabbatai Zevi, and Theodore Herzl.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i><b><i>&#x2014;</i>LIBRARY JOURNAL</b></i></b><br><br>&#x201c;...Prochnik is possessed of an agile, probing mind, and in his latest, he applies it to understanding the life of Gershom Sholem, intellectual mystic and friend to Walter Benjamin, devotee of the Kabbalah and devoted Zionist.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;</i>LITERARY HUB</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;Books&nbsp;</b>by Jewish writers on Jewish topics usually carry a heavy personal subtext...what does it mean to be a Jew&#x2014;for&nbsp;<i>me</i>&nbsp;to be a Jew?... The genius of George Prochnik, in his new book&nbsp;<b><i>Stranger in a Strange Land: Searching for Gershom Scholem in Jerusalem</i></b>, is that he surfaces this subtext and makes it his explicit subject. The result is an immersive, passionate work that is really two books spliced together. The first is a quasi-biography of Gershom Scholem, the pioneering scholar of Jewish mysticism, whose life encompassed the greatest Jewish quandaries of the twentieth century. The second is a personal memoir, in which Prochnik describes his own experience of moving from America to Israel, where he lived and raised a family for more than a decade, and then moving back again. Sections of these two tales alternate, creating a meaningful counterpoint, for they are really variations on the same story. Prochnik loves Scholem&#x2014;and this is clearly a book written out of love, not mere interest or duty&#x2014;because he offers a role model for a soul in quest of an authentic way to be Jewish...Prochnik performs impressive feats of concise elucidation, taking the reader through Scholem&#x2019;s life, times, and work in under 500 pages...This book is worthy of the rich, ambivalent, complex, and compelling stories it has to tell; more than a work of history, it is a document of the living spirit of Judaism.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;BARNES &amp; NOBLE REVIEW</b><br><br>&#x201c;In his previous book, George Prochnik gave us a moving portrait of Stefan Zweig, the Viennese Jew who wrote tenderly of the &#x2018;world of yesterday&#x2019;&#x2014;the liberal Europe that collapsed with apocalyptic consequences in the 1930s&#x2014;and killed himself in his Brazilian exile rather than die in its flames. In his powerful new book, Prochnik offers us a portrait of a Berlin Jew, fifteen years Zweig&#x2019;s junior, who made a very different choice: to renounce the dream of a liberal Europe and remake himself, and his people, in Palestine. Gerhard Scholem, who would become the famous scholar of the Kabbalah Gershom Scholem, upheld a cultural version of Zionism, and spoke of the need for Arab&#x2013;Jewish coexistence; yet over time he accommodated himself to the often brutal practices of the Jewish state, which turned Palestinians into strangers in their own land. In the late 1980s, as Palestinians in the Occupied Territories launched their first Intifada, Prochnik, an American Jew from the suburbs, settled in Jerusalem with his family, inspired by Scholem&#x2019;s vision of a renewed Jewish cultural vitality, only to discover that this vision lay in ruins, no match for the muscular, expansionist Zionism with which it had made a marriage of convenience. In<i>&nbsp;Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, Prochnik writes of Scholem&#x2019;s dream&#x2014;and of his own&#x2014;with a rare and affecting combination of authority and vulnerability. This is a deeply felt work of critique and elegy, a probing examination of the subject of our time: the temptations, and the dangers, of belonging.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Adam Shatz, contributing editor at the <i>London Review of Books</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Prochnik&#x2019;s book presents an&nbsp;uneasy political&#x2013;mystical tour through Scholem&#x2019;s writing and his own Jerusalem, now lost forever. What makes it a unique and brilliant contribution to current debates about Palestine is that in his reading of Scholem, Prochnik finds&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;both the echoes of the forces&#x2014;messianic,&nbsp;national, and colonial&#x2014;that keep tearing the region apart, and also the kernel of&nbsp;something precious to be salvaged. From the abyss of our despair, Prochnik manages to do what so few others can: imagine&nbsp;a future of living together.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Eyal Weizman, author of&nbsp;<i>Hollow Land: Israel&#x2019;s Architecture of Occupation&nbsp;</i>and director of the Centre for Research Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;George Prochnik is a great practitioner of the art of auto-nonfiction, the writing of intellectual history in which a past life is quickened again by the keen presence of the author. Yet Prochnik never obtrudes; rather, his beautiful sentences guide us, gently but surely, through both the often-complex thinking of his subjects and the often-traumatic events of their lives. As in his biography of the mercurial Stefan Zweig, alienation is foregrounded in this account of the scholarly Gershom Scholem (who inscribed it in his adopted name, Gershom, meaning &#x201c;stranger in a strange land&#x201d;). But loss is lightened here by the Scholemian conviction that the Kabbalah, the mystical tradition of biblical interpretation of which he was the world expert, offers not only a key to the broken past but also a call to its healing. If the Kabbalah appeared to Scholem as an allegory of Jewish exile, Zionism was his way to bring this wandering to an end. As a young man Prochnik was fired by similar hopes, and in what he describes elsewhere as a &#x2018;shadow-arc&#x2019; of his subject, he too emigrated to Jerusalem&#x2014;only, like Scholem, to be disillusioned by the state politics he encountered there.

Writers of fantasy, says Cooper, deal in "myth, legend, folktale, the mystery of dream and the greater mystery of Time. With all that haunting our minds, it isn't surprising that we write stories about an ordinary world in which extraordinary things happen." <p>This fascinating collection of essays, compelling reading for any parent, teacher, librarian, or booklover, contains 20 years of an author's reflections on the nature of craft, imagination, and her young audience. Some of the topics are focused on fantasy; others range from the theater to literacy, from poetry to war. </p><p>Although Susan Cooper is also a gifted playwright and television screenwriter (<i>Foxfire</i>, <i>The Dollmaker, To Dance with the White Dog</i>), her novels for young adults contain her best work. Her concern for children's literature permeates <i>Dreams and Wishes</i>, making it a book that is both entertaining and disturbing. At the heart of Cooper's work is a passionate plea for the recognition, in an image-oriented world, of the all-encompassing power and value of the written word.</p>Newbery award winner Cooper has collected 14 of her speeches in a compilation that should find a ready spot in library professional collections. The essays, presented in the order in which they were written, show an evolution in Cooper's thoughts about writing for children. When her <i>The Dark Is Rising</i> was voted a 1974 Newbery Honor Book, Cooper barely knew what the Newbery award was, and only after attending that summer's ALA convention did she realize that there was a world of people who enjoyed nothing better than discussing children's books. By the last essay, she is a beloved author, who draws readers in to her celebration of the mystery of creativity and keenly appreciates the many messengers who bring her works to the attention of children. Along the way, Cooper also examines her childhood relationship with books and the effect of her immigration to the U.S. on her writing and demonstrates clearly how we can all participate in bringing the magic of reading into children's lives. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Cook without a Book: Meatless Meals: Recipes and Techniques for Part-Time and Full-Time Vegetarians: A Cookbook</h2><p>There are a lot of compelling reasons to eat less meat these days, but the shift to a totally or even<br>partly vegetarian lifestyle is easier said than done for many beef, poultry, and fish lovers.

Oatmeal Worth Waking Up For is a whole new ball game. It starts with flavored soymilk, with dried or pureed fruit added to naturally sweeten the oatmeal as it cooks. (In fact, you shouldn't need additional sweetener unless, of course, you want it.)<br><br>The possible flavor combinations read more like a dessert menu than breakfast: imagine chocolate-cherry, pumpkin spice, figs and cloves (for Newton fans), or one of my favorites--oatmeal with prunes, vanilla, and walnuts.

Turns out they're not. Applesauce is not distinct enough, and the more concentrated apple butter is acidic enough to curdle even soymilk.<br><br>You can use light soymilk, which has fewer calories, but I prefer the flavor and richness of oatmeal made with regular soymilk. I prefer soymilk to dairy milk because it's lower in calories, and of the nondairy milks, it's widely available and comes in chocolate.<br><br>This recipe can easily be halved or quartered for 1 or 2 servings. If you like thinner oatmeal, stir in water at the end of cooking, or splash a little extra soymilk over the oatmeal once you've served it up.<br><br>Spraying your knife with cooking spray makes it easier to cut dried fruit.</p><h2>A Pig in Provence: Good Food and Simple Pleasures in the South of France</h2><p>From the publisher of Under the Tuscan Sun comes another extraordinary memoir of a woman embarking on a new lifethis time in the South of France.

Scholar and adviser to Tony Blair&#39;s government, Christopher Catherwood chronicles and analyzes how Churchill created the artificial monarchy of Iraq after World War I, thereby forcing together unfriendly peoples under a single ruler. The map of the Middle East that Churchill created led to the rise of Saddam Hussein and the wars in which American troops fought in 1991 and 2003. Defying a global wave of nationalistic sentiment, and the desire of subject peoples to rule themselves, Winston Churchill put together the broken pieces of the Ottoman Empire and created a Middle Eastern powder keg. Inducing Arabs under the rule of the Ottoman Turks to rebel against their oppressors, the British and French during World War I convinced the Hashemite clan that they would rule over Syria. In fact, Britain had promised the territory to the French. To make amends, Churchill created the nation of Iraq and made the Hashemite leader, Feisel, king of a land to which he had no connections at all. Eight pages of photographs add to this fascinating history on Churchill&#39;s decision and the terrible legacy of the Ottoman Empire&#39;s collapse.</p><p>As consultant to the Strategy Unit of Blair's cabinet, Christopher Cather-wood worked in the Admirality building, where Churchill was based as First Lord of the Admirality in 1939&#x2013;1940. He teaches history at Cambridge University and each summer at the University of Richmond (Virginia), where he is an annual Writer in Residence for their History Department.This compelling volume raises eerie echoes of present-day Iraq. In the aftermath of WWI, France and Britain competed for the Mideastern leftovers of the Ottoman Empire. The British grabbed Palestine, attempted to set up puppet monarchies in Arabia and in 1921 cobbled together hostile peoples&#x2014;Kurds and Sunni and Shiite Arabs&#x2014;into the artificial and unstable kingdom of Iraq, ruled by the imposed Hashemite king Faisal. Cambridge historian Catherwood asserts that this form of indirect rule was "empire lite" as fashioned by Churchill, then colonial minister. The British, drained economically by the world war, were greedy for spoils and wanted the benefits of empire on the cheap. The vastness of Iraq proved impossible to govern by a reduced garrison. Catherwood, a consultant to Tony Blair's cabinet, sees contemporary parallels in the unlearned lessons of "imperial overreach." Unwanted paternalistic protectorates have a way of imploding, Catherwood notes. Churchill conceded wryly that Britain was spending millions "for the privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano out of which we are in no circumstances to get anything worth having." In a readable historical essay stretched into a short book, Catherwood demonstrates yet again that one generation's pragmatism can be a later generation's tragedy. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by <i>PW</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His energy seems to be rivalled only by that of Joe Papp; in 1954 (The Pajama Game) Prince was the youngest producer on Broadway, and now, 20 years later, he still is -- which says all that needs to be said about the Great White Way, which apparently Prince himself (due to the unpleasantries involved in moving Candide from Brooklyn to Manhattan) is on the verge of quitting. He discusses his successes and failures with candor and a total lack of sentiment, albeit not without pride -- mistakes he and others made, the shows he did for love and those he did for money (A Little Night Music). Also of interest is the practical info on such things as appropriate theater size, opening cities, and when to extend (or not) a run or go on the road.

From humble origins, Coxinga&#39;s father became the richest man in China and Admiral of the Emperor&#39;s navy during the Ming Dynasty. As his eldest son, Coxinga was given the best education and developed a love of poetry and the study of Confucius. From this unlikely beginning, it took the invasion of south China by the Manchu and the subsequent loss of both his parents - his father defected to the Manchu and his mother, a Japanese Samurai, died in battle - to turn Coxinga from scholar to warrior. Fiercely loyal to his exiled Emperor, Coxinga fought against overwhelming odds until his defeat drove him out to sea and over to Taiwan - at the time a lawless set of islands inhabited by cannibals.

An enthralling epic that is also an amazingly intimate portrait, <i>The Life of Elizabeth I</i> is a mesmerizing, stunning reading experience.</p><p>The long life and powerful personality of England's beloved Virgin Queen have eternal appeal, and popular historian Alison Weir depicts both with panache. She's especially good at evoking the physical texture of Tudor England: the elaborate royal gowns (actually an intricate assembly of separate fabric panels buttoned together over linen shifts), the luxurious but unhygienic palaces (Elizabeth got the only "close stool"; most members of her retinue relieved themselves in the courtyards), the huge meals heavily seasoned to disguise the taste of spoiled meat. Against this earthy backdrop, Elizabeth's intelligence and formidable political skills stand in vivid relief. She may have been autocratic, devious, even deceptive, but these traits were required to perform a 45-year tightrope walk between the two great powers of Europe, France and Spain. Both countries were eager to bring small, weak England under their sway and to safely marry off its inconveniently independent queen. Weir emphasizes Elizabeth's precarious position as a ruling woman in a man's world, suggesting plausibly that the single life was personally appealing as well as politically expedient for someone who had seen many ambitious ladies--including her own mother--ruined and even executed for just the appearance of sexual indiscretions. The author's evaluations of such key figures in Elizabeth's reign as the Earl of Leicester (arguably the only man she ever loved) and William Cecil (her most trusted adviser) are equally cogent and respectful of psychological complexity. Weir does a fine job of retelling this always-popular story for a new generation. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Perhaps the most influential sovereign England has ever known, Queen Elizabeth I remained an extremely private person throughout her reign, keeping her own counsel and sharing secrets with no one--not even her closest, most trusted advisers.

I was not prepared for the reaction it generated. I received over 10,000 letters, over half of them from people "coming out" for the first time about their pain and depression. Complete strangers wrote to me because I was the safest person they could share with. Not friends, not family members, but me -- someone they didn't know! I also wasn't prepared for the intensity of my frustration as I came to understand how many Black women and men are suffering silently. </p><p> The folks who wrote to me were scared -- some of them terrified -- to breathe a word to anyone; they were paralyzed by the fear that no one would understand or accept them. Their fear was echoed in conversation upon conversation I had while traveling across the country giving talks about how we are doing -- about waking up in pain each day -- to audiences that ranged from CEOs to regular churchgoers. After my talks, person after person would come to me to confide that they, too, were "going through it." </p><p> Sometimes I would come home from these trips totally drained in my heart and soul, having heard stories like the one I heard from a man whose two sisters are home suffering from major depression. He can't talk about it, nor can his family, even though he's a respected physician and his brother is a well-regarded man of the cloth! </p><p> If I'm honest with myself, and with you, the fact is that I'm more like these folks than I care to admit. If then <i>Essence</i> editor in chief Diane Weathers hadn't sensed what I was going through and asked me to write the piece, I don't know how much longer it would have taken before I really told someone I was depressed -- or if I would ever have told anyone before the point where there was no hiding it anymore. </p><p> In fact, my mom, dad, and sister didn't know what I was going through until I mailed them a draft of the article and wrote a kind of offhand note saying, "I wanted you to see this before it came out." I didn't even ask for their responses! </p><p> My mom called immediately. "I'm so sad you didn't feel like you could come to me. Maybe there was something I could have done!" And my sister told me that she, too, had been through the fire. But I was so used to handling things on my own that I believed telling them would only make them worry. I knew I wasn't suicidal, even though I <i>was</i> dying on the inside. The pain I feel is so hard to talk about that my closest family still hears more about it when I'm in front of large groups than one-on-one. </p><p> These days I use my visibility to talk about pain and how we mask it. Every time I step up to the microphone I "out" myself as someone in pain. I do it because I know that by sharing my story, my fragility, insecurity, frailty, and woundedness, I liberate someone else to do the same. </p><p> Sometimes the liberation comes through humor. In the months after the <i>Essence</i> piece came out, people would see me at events and shyly come over to me. I knew they wanted to mention the article and talk about depression, but didn't know how, so I would break the ice. "I can tell you read the <i>Essence</i> article," I would say. "Don't worry. I took my medication today. Everything's okay -- and you don't have to whisper the word 'depression'!" That little bit of humor, that easy laugh, was usually all it took to open the gates to honest talk about something we think is shameful. And I'm telling you, there is not one among us who has not been touched by this! </p><p> This book is as much about identifying depression as it is about the power of testimony. Some of the people whose stories are in this book were willing to bare their souls for the record, in the name of a cause bigger than themselves -- and that includes some of the most well-known names here. Others were willing and even eager to share their stories, but feared that giving their names could jeopardize their livelihoods or hurt their families, especially their young children; these are not famous people and I have respected their requests for anonymity because I believe their stories are the most valuable thing they have to offer. Finally, I have drawn on magazine and television interviews from a handful of famous people who have spoken publicly about their struggles with depression. </p><p> More important than anything else is that the thousands of people who have communicated with me about this in person, in writing, or on the phone have broken the silence that makes depression so lethal. In the passages below Set Shakur, Mama DeBarge, Joyce Walker Joseph, and Diane Weathers come out to me about their depression. </p><p> <b>Testimony</b> </p><p> If you ever danced or sang along to the infectious music of the DeBarge family, you can thank Etterlene "Mama" DeBarge for bringing all those gifted artists into our world. Sadly, her marriage to their father was nothing like the sweet music her children made. A jealous, controlling man, he kept "Mama" pregnant for most of fifteen years -- pregnant, lonely, and depressed. She shared with me a chilling excerpt from her forthcoming memoir: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I lived every day in my own personal hell. I had noticed myself becoming more reclusive and despondent, and I spent every waking moment paranoid and afraid. I very rarely had visitors, and at one point I had even stopped answering the phone. The telephone was a luxury that I had learned to do without after my husband accused me of "talking to another man on the phone." It was actually a wrong number, and I had made the mistake of answering. It's a funny thing, depression; it's the only intangible thing I know of that can actually cause very real, very tangible changes in a person. The burden and the pain of my life weighed me down like a wet woolen blanket. I willed myself through every day by repeating to myself over and over again, <i>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me</i>, and I would make it at least one more day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "Mama" made it through many days, and helped bring her children to realize their gifts and share them, but how much richer would all their lives have been if only she had been able to get the help she needed when she needed it most? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., is the Jesse Climenko Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, as well as the founder and executive director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice. This is what he told me about powerful Black men and depression: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> African-American leaders in particular face tremendous obstacles rising to the top, and even greater challenges staying there. We are the face of the struggle and are expected to always show strength, grit, determination, and confidence, when the burden of depression is doing everything it can to pull us back down. It is time that we all talk about our depression, and fight with the same vigor we bring to the fight for racial justice. We must reveal the darker moments and show, despite the pain that tries to bring us down, we realize that seeking treatment, talking through our pain, and taking the mask off our helplessness will not only make us stronger, but will allow others to appreciate the fact that depression touches us all. But we can fight back, and we can win. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> His words were much on my mind as I talked with two other powerful Black men, Carl Anthony Foreman and Bill Lynch, about their own pain. </p><p> Carl Anthony Foreman, the sixty-two-year-old powerhouse real estate mogul and owner of radio properties, was diagnosed only four years ago as suffering from bipolar disorder. For most of his life he experienced mood swings, at times feeling like he could conquer the world and buying up tons of property. At other times he felt bone weary, unable to talk, staying in bed in a darkened room for two to three days at a time. </p><p> Despite the range of his achievements his depression led him to move away from his wife and three sons when his youngest was fifteen years old. Although he supported them and lived nearby, when he sent the family on vacation, he couldn't go with them. </p><p> In some ways Carl's resources buffered him because he didn't have to go to a regular "job" every day. He would call his office at 3:00 a.m. "so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone." Then he'd leave a message that he wouldn't be in the office for a day or two so nobody would call and he could stay home alone, in silence. He wouldn't answer his phone. He would respond to voice mails in the middle of the night so he didn't have to talk to people. This strategy also gave him the advantages of surprise and respect, since people assumed he was working 24/7. </p><p> For a while he tried Zoloft and Lexapro, but they had side effects that, for him, were worse than the symptoms. "Chemical imbalance in our brains is no different than any other affliction we might have in our bodies. It's just that when it happens to the brain, it affects how you act and how you communicate." </p><p> Diagnosis late in life was a blessing and now Carl manages his depression by putting less stress on himself and not overworking. He attends fewer events, not stretching himself so thin, and does much of his business by phone. He also calls his therapist when he starts to feel overwhelmed. He's been coming out about his depression person by person, and each time he does, it's a little more liberating. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sekyiwa (Set) Shakur is a thirty-one-year-old high-powered fashion designer and sister of the late Tupac Shakur. She's a warm and open spirit, someone who is clear about who she is and who she's becoming. She's also a woman who uses her own pain and challenges to help others. At twenty-three she began mentoring girls at the YWCA, because she feels it's important for young people to "hear us speak our truth, so that they know healing is possible." </p><p> She remembers always being uncomfortable in her own skin. Often she felt angry and would argue endlessly with a...</p>"<i>Black Pain</i> is just the conversation starter that we need to begin tackling the taboo topic of depression.

The Peabody emerged from the war-torn, post-Civil War South in 1869 to become one of the finest hotels in America. Its reputation for comfort, service, and fine dining grew along with Memphis&#39;s stature as &#34;the river city, cotton capital, and birthplace of the blues.&#34; The most famous and infamous citizens of the era stayed at the original Peabody in its day. There, plantations were won or lost on a roll of the dice. After more than 50 years, the original hotel was replaced by a new 12-story, 615-room hotel in 1925. It was then that the hotel&#39;s name became synonymous with elegance. It also became the social center of Memphis and the mid-South, and a haunt for the rich and famous. The celebrated ducks swimming in the marble lobby fountain, parties in the skyway, or dancing on the open plantation roof to the music of the most renowned bands and orchestras of the day have all been part of this fabulous hotel&#39;s history. Today, the fully restored Peabody retains its reputation for legendary Southern hospitality and tasteful elegance. The hotel continues to serve as an anchor for the restoration and revitalization of the downtown area of one of America&#39;s most important cities.</p><p>In Images of America: The Peabody Hotel, authors Scott Faragher and Katherine Harrington celebrate this legendary landmark&#39;s long and fascinating history with both vintage and current photographs, highlighted by informative text.</p><h2>The Voynich Hotel Vol. 3</h2><p><p><b>A KILLER GETAWAY</b></p><p>All Taizou wanted was to leave behind his past as a yakuza, but now his enemies have tracked him down and are out for blood.

Do�a Ramona witnessed many changes in the intervening years, but her memories of the land and customs she knew as a child are indelible.<br><br> For Do�a Ramona as well as for countless generations of Mexican Americans, memories of rural life recall <i>la querida tierra,</i> the beloved land. Through good times and bad, the land provided sustenance. Today, many of those homesteads and ranches have succumbed to bulldozers that have brought housing projects and strip malls in their wake.<br><br> Now a writer and a photographer who have long been intimately involved with Arizona's Hispanic community have preserved the voices and images of men and women who are descendants of pioneer ranching and farming families in southern Arizona. Ranging from Tucson to the San Rafael Valley and points in between, this book documents the contributions of Mexican American families whose history and culture are intertwined with the lifestyle of the contemporary Southwest. These were hardy, self-reliant pioneers who settled in what were then remote areas. Their stories tell of love affairs with the land and a way of life that is rapidly disappearing.<br><br> Through oral histories and a captivating array of historic and contemporary photos, <i>Beloved Land</i> records a vibrant and resourceful way of life that has contributed so much to the region. Individuals like Do�a Ramona tell stories about rural life, farming, ranching, and vaquero culture that enrich our knowledge of settlement, culinary practices, religious traditions, arts, and education of Hispanic settlers of Arizona. They talk frankly about how the land changed hands&#x2014;not always by legal means&#x2014;and tell how they feel about modern society and the disappearance of the rural lifestyle.<br><br> "Our ranch homes and fields, our chapels and corrals may have been bulldozed by progress or renovated into spas and guest ranches that never whisper our ancestors' names," writes Patricia Preciado Martin. "The story of our beautiful and resilient heritage will never be silenced . . . as long as we always remember to run our fingers through the nourishing and nurturing soil of our history." <i>Beloved Land</i> works that soil as it revitalizes that history for the generations to come.</p><p><b>Patricia Preciado Martin</b> is a native Arizonan and a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Arizona.

Set around Bordeaux during the first turbulent years of the reign of Louis XIV, <i>The Women's War</i> sees two women taking central stage in a battle for all France.

From the time he raced the Husquvarna he bought with &#x201c;ones, fives, tens, change; all of my savings,&#x201d; until his retirement at Unadilla in 1989, Bob Hannah won races and championships, spoke his mind, and signed almost every autograph-seeker&#x2019;s program. Told as an oral history by Hannah himself and by those who know him best, this book is full of stories that could only have happened to a character as colorful as the Hurricane.</p><p>The tale author Tom Madigan tells is the life of an American original, a boy who went from riding dirt bikes in the desert with his father to taking the motocross world by surprise. By the time Hannah retired in 1989, he had collected 70 AMA National wins, seven AMA National titles, a MX des Nations title, and legions of devoted fans. When inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999, he was second to none in both total and consecutive wins. Richly illustrated, this is the definitive biography of the Hurricane.</p><p> </p></i></p><p>Tom Madigan has been part of the California car culture since the end of World War II. As a journalist, he has covered all kinds of motorsports, but his first love has always been the sport in which he participated: Top Fuel drag racing. Madigan is the author of several books, including Motorbooks\u2019 critically acclaimed Fuel and Guts: The Birth of Top Fuel Drag Racing; Edelbrock: Made in the USA; and Hurricane: The Bob Hannah Story. He resides in Sonora, California, with his extremely patient wife, Darlene.Tom Madigan has been part of the California motorsport culture since the beginning. He not only competed against drag racing&#39;s pioneers, he has been writing about motorsports since the 1960s as a contributor for Motorcade magazine, a feature editor for Popular Hot Rodding magazine and the author of several books, including Fuel and Guts: The Birth of Top Fuel Drag Racing and Edelbrock: Made in the USA.<p>&#x201c;Bob Hannah fans who rejoiced at the excellent episode of The Motorcross Files dedicated to him won&#x2019;t want to miss this book. Hurricane! chronicles the life and times of one of the greatest American motocross heroes of all time, with explicit detail and excellent photography. It&#x2019;s clear that the author has a close relationship with the subject, and that appears to have resulted in unparallel access to the reclusive Hannah&#x2019;s life story.&#x201d; &#x2013; Bryan Stealey, <i>Racer X Illustrated</i> </p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This new, 178-page book written by Tom Madigan explores Hanna&#x2019;s life through Hurricane&#x2019;s own words and the words of those who knew him.

The Bob Hannah Story</i> blew me away. Tom Madigan&#x2019;s approach to telling Hannah&#x2019;s story is unique and quite effective. Instead of relying on just his own research, Madigan calls upon many of Hannah&#x2019;s friends, foes and fellow competitors to help pen the tale. He then goes to &#x201c;the horse&#x2019;s mouth&#x201d; and has Hannah himself fill in the blanks.

In 1933, 23-year-old Richard Maury set sail from Connecticut in Cimba, a 35-foot schooner, bound for Fiji. Maury&#39;s account is an extraordinary tale of high adventure, acclaimed for its exquisite depictions of the sea&#39;s unbearable beauty and annihilating fury.</p><p>6 1-hour cassettes<p>"There is a spare, taut beauty, a stinging intensity, a fine exhilaration, in this saga of wind and wave."--<i>New York Times</i> </p><p>"There have not been many [tales] like it, and none so brilliantly gleaming with such aspects of wind and sea."--<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> </p><p>In November 1933, 23-year-old Richard Maury set sail from Connecticut in <i>Cimba</i>, a 35-foot Nova Scotia schooner, leaving behind the icy grasp of a Depression-era New England winter. With one other crewman he shaped a course for the South Seas, where there were still islands so remote as to be reached only by perilous voyages across vast stretches of empty ocean. At that time such voyages were rarely undertaken in small boats, but Maury was determined to have the adventure while it could still be had. </p><p>Finely wrought, with elegant clarity, <i>The Saga of Cimba</i> is a magical book. In Jonathan Raban's words, "It is precisely because the voyage was so fraught with difficulty and tragedy, and Maury had to work so hard to reconcile the disasters that befell him with his steadfast love of the sea, that the book rings true. The joy is real, but it is wrested from the teeth of experience by a writer of quite extraordinary skill, cunning, and determination." Maury found the South Seas of his dreams, but in doing so he had to weather three storms, serious illness, the deaths of two friends, and finally, the loss of his beloved <i>Cimba</i> on the reefs of Fiji. </p><p>First published in 1939 and out of print for nearly three decades, <i>The Saga of Cimba</i> has been compared with the works of Dana, Conrad, and Saint-Exupery. Maury's exquisite depictions of the sea's almost unbearable beauty and annihilating fury are unforgettable. Truly, as Raban says, the startling brilliance of <i>The Saga of Cimba</i> qualifies it as one of the best books ever written about the sea. </p><p>"The most eloquent prose hymn ever written to the exhilaration, the beauty, and the sheer joy of being at sea."--from the introduction by Jonathan Raban </p><p>"Not at all the conventional small-boat yarn, for Mr. Maury can feel and he can write. . . . Superior adventure, whose spirit recalls that of the books of Anne Morrow Lindbergh."--<i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p>"What comes back to you, overwhelmingly and beautifully, is [Maury's] enormously successful description of what it's like to sail a small boat across the Pacific."--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> </p><p>"One of the best sea yarns of all time."--<i>Rudder</i></p></p><h2>Expository Notes on the Prophet: Isaiah</h2><p>hardcover with dust jacket</p><p></p><h2>Glove Affairs: The Romance, History, and Tradition of the Baseball Glove</h2><p><p>In addition to chronicling the amazing history of the glove,<i> Glove Affairs</i> has detailed chapters featuring experts' tips on buying, breaking in, and fixing a glove; Major Leaguers' glove secrets and superstitions; insights into glove endorsements and glove collecting; and page after page of hysterical, eye-opening stories from players, coaches, &nbsp;and industry insiders.

His sports writing has appeared in such national periodicals as and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i><i>, ESPN</i> the Magazine, <i>Men's Health</i>, the <i>New York Times</i><i>,</i><i> <i>Sports Illustrated</i></i>, and <i>the Sporting News</i>. He lives in ChicagoHow is it that Larry King remembers every detail about his first baseball glove, but Hall of Fame shortstop Ozzie Smith can't recall a thing about his? Such is the mystery of the baseball glove, a simple piece of sporting equipment that is both functional and, for reasons that are hard to pin down, often unforgettable. This handsome and smartly illustrated history of fielder's gloves is rich with information about and appreciation for the game. Lieberman explains how ballplayers were once thought unmanly if they used gloves to field thrown and batted balls and how big-leaguers vary in their approach to picking out and maintaining fielder's gloves; New York Yankee Derek Jeter opts for a new glove at the start of every season, but former Baltimore Oriole Brooks Robinson, probably the greatest defensive third baseman ever, would use his "until it was ragged." Lieberman's book does not require any intellectual heavy lifting, but with plenty of archival photos and a bundle of funny anecdotes, it gives readers an amiable way to welcome the new season. <i>Kevin Canfield</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Businesses make millions of decisions every day. But once in a great while a leader makes a truly game-changing decision that shifts not only the strategy of a single company but how everyone does business. These big decisions are counterintuitive-they go against the conventional wisdom. In hindsight, taking a different direction may seem easy, but these bet-the-company moves involve drama, doubt, and high tension. What made Apple's board bring back Steve Jobs to the company? How did Johnson &amp; Johnson decide to recall every bottle of Tylenol after a poisoning scare that involved only a small batch of the drug? What made Henry Ford decide to double the wages of his autoworkers, and how did that change the American economy for the next century? <br><br>Here management consultant Verne Harnish, the CEO of Gazelles, and <i>Fortune</i>'s editors provide the background stories behind the greatest business decisions of all time. In this fully original book, you'll get a glimpse into the thought processes leading up to these groundbreaking moments and will learn how the decisions have shaped the thinking of today's top leaders. The book also contains an insightful foreword by management guru <b>Jim Collins</b>, the author of <i>Built To Last</i> and <i>Good To Great</i>, which explains the importance of decision making in creating a successful company. <br><br><strong>ADVANCED PRAISE FOR FORTUNE Greatest Business Decisions<br></strong><br>"CEOs make thousands of decisions every year, but only a few of them have dramatic impact on a company's brand, performance, and culture.

Lear travelled constantly, across countries still dangerous and unknown to Western Europeans, usually alone or with one servant, often on foot. As he travelled he captured in word and illustration the sublimity of the landscape, the richness of costume and the character of the people he encountered. Victorian Europe was both appalled and fascinated by the Greece he portrayed, whilst through his bizarre cartoons he received recognition from the Surrealists as a forerunner of their movement.</p><p></p><h2>Everyday Asian: From Soups to Noodles, From Barbecues to Curries, Your Favorite Asian Recipes Made Easy</h2><p><p>Love Asian food but too intimidated to make it at home? Do you find yourself flipping through an Asian cookbook, and then going out for Thai noodles or Korean Barbecue, rather than going into your kitchen? When Marnie Henricksson gave up her noodle shop in Greenwich Village, and settled down to raise her kids in the 'burbs, she had difficulty finding her favorite Asian ingredients at the local supermarket. So, Marnie tweaked her recipes to work with readily available ingredients, allowing her and her family to enjoy Asian food everyday. In Everyday Asian, Marnie shares seventy-five of her favorite dishes with home cooks.</p><p>As the recipes draw on the traditional cuisines of Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and India, Marnie begins the book with a chapter detailing how to find, make, and store necessary ingredients, as well as giving advice on invaluable kitchen equipment for Asian cooking.</p><p>Here's your opportunity to master classicdishes such as Pad Thai, Chinese Pork Roasts, Spring Rolls, and Vietnamese Pho, and expand your imagination with Marnie's innovative recipes for Asian Pesto (replace pine nuts with peanuts and Italian basil with Thai basil, cilantro, and mint) and Spicy Chicken Wings (an American classic with a good dose of Asian spices).</p><p>It's clear from the abundance of Japanese, Korean, Indian, and Vietnamese restaurants that Americans are crazy about Asian food; however, cooking the real thing at home has always been a problem if you don't live near an Asian market. Now, with Marnie's easy-to-follow recipes, enjoying Asian food as often as you like is just a supermarket aisle away.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marnie Henricksson</strong> was born and raised in Minnesota and first became interested in food at Cornell University. At Cornell, she studied Economics but between classes made and sold French pastry to coffee shops on campus. Marnie then spent a year and a half in Asia, sampling local ingredients and cuisines, and becoming hooked on Asian food. In 1991 she opened "Marnie&#x2019;s Noodle Shop" in New York City, where she put to use all that she learned in her travels. Marnie is a full-time writer and lives in Putnam Valley, NY.</p>Everyday Asian, by Marnie Henricksson, capitalizes on the author's experiences running a noodle shop. This sort of restaurant appeals to young people for its variety, simplicity, and economy. The book's recipes recapitulate that theme with such dishes as Vietnamese Cabbage, Chicken, and Mint Salad, whose peanuts and chicken add protein to soothing greens. Korean Beef Noodles emphasize garlic's pungency and chiles' heat. For more substantial fare, Henricksson offers pork chops scented with Indian spices and Singapore Chile Shrimp with its distinctive sweet-hot sauce. All these recipes require a pantry of standard Asian cooking staples, but the ubiquity of these canned and bottled ingredients makes them easy to obtain. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It shows that, not only is the entire Letter arranged in fifteen units that function as a comprehensive chiastic structure, but that each of these fifteen units in turn exhibits its own chiastic structure. By attending carefully to the structure and rhetoric of Ephesians, this work demonstrates how the implied audience is persuaded and empowered by the progression of the Letter to walk in love and so contribute to the cosmic unity of all things in Christ.</p><p>John Paul Heil is Professor of New Testament at Catholic University of America.

This is the first time it has been the subject of a substantial separate publication, providing comprehensive coverage of its contents and decoration.<br>The manuscript was presented to Isabella by Francisco de Rojas, apparently to mark the occasion of the double marriage of her son and daughter to the children of Maximilian, King of the Romans, and his first wife, Mary of Burgundy. De Rojas had acted for Isabella and her husband, King Ferdinand of Aragon, throughout the marriage negotiations, which were concluded in 1495. Isabella had a strong interest in Flemish art and this sumptuous devotional book must have been much to her taste.<br>Breviaries, normally produced for the use of the clergy, are much less common than books of hours. They contain a larger and more varied body of texts, affording their artists a wider range of subject matter and extensive decorative opportunities. In the case of the Isabella Breviary, no effort was spared to produce an illustrative scheme on a grand scale. Two outstanding workshops of the day are represented. The greater part of the manuscript is due to the Master of the Dresden Prayerbook, whose contribution includes a number of unusual Old Testament subjects. Many of the illustrations of saints are by the Master of James IV of Scotland. In addition there are four magnificent miniatures closely related to (and possibly in the hand of) Gerard David.</p><p>Janet Backhouse is Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts in The British Library.</p><h2>A Guide to the Historic Architecture of Eastern North Carolina (Richard Hampton Jenrette Architecture and the Decorative Arts)</h2><p>Eastern North Carolina boasts some of the oldest and most distinctive architecture in the state, from colonial churches and antebellum plantation houses to the imperiled lighthouses of the late nineteenth century.

In his thoughtful biography <i>Can't You Hear Me Callin'</i>, Richard D. Smith argues that "no single artist has had as broad an impact on American music." As evidence, he highlights dozens of country and rock &amp; roll musicians, both white and black, who were inspired by Monroe's powerful mandolin playing on the Grand Ole Opry's weekly broadcasts. (Chuck Berry's "Maybelline," for example, is an almost note-for-note copy of Monroe's instrumental "Ida Red.") Until now, however, Monroe's hesitation to reveal personal details has kept his personality as mysterious as one of the foggy mountaintops he sang about in his signature high lonesome tenor. <p> Bluegrass audiences required a rural, Southern authenticity from the "Father of Bluegrass," and Monroe was slow to deny their exaggerations. Smith, however, dismisses many of the backwoodsy stories that grew up around the Monroe myth, instead emphasizing truer biographical elements: loneliness, fear of abandonment, compulsiveness with women. Perhaps the book's main scholarly step forward is the depth of interviews and research the author conducted with the women in Monroe's life. Indeed, Smith remarks that "without exception," none of Monroe's platonic or romantic women friends had been interviewed before. These women reveal a second Bill Monroe, relaxed and gentle in private despite his imperious manner onstage.</p><p> Much of the book relies on the archives of the late Ralph Rinzler, a Smithsonian folklorist whose plans to write a Monroe biography were thwarted by his untimely death. Taking up where Rinzler left off, Smith employs solid scholarship and thorough fieldwork, yet he remains clearly in awe of his subject, ranking him as a "true giant of American music" on the level of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Hank Williams, and Charles Ives. <i>Can't You Hear Me Callin'</i> is the first published attempt at a comprehensive, critical biography of Bill Monroe. Surely, it won't be the last--a testament to the enigmatic genius whose every note extended one of our most emotive and demanding musical genres. <i>--Edward Skoog</i></p>Richard D.

Or does the mind protect itself by banishing traumatic memories from consciousness? How victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue in psychology today, spilling out of consulting rooms and laboratories to capture headlines, rupture families, provoke legislative change, and influence criminal trials and civil suits. This book, by a clinician who is also a laboratory researcher, is the first comprehensive, balanced analysis of the clinical and scientific evidence bearing on this issue--and the first to provide definitive answers to the urgent questions at the heart of the controversy.</p><p>Synthesizing clinical case reports and the vast research literature on the effects of stress, suggestion, and trauma on memory, Richard McNally arrives at significant conclusions, first and foremost that traumatic experiences are indeed unforgettable. Though people sometimes do not think about disturbing experiences for long periods of time, traumatic events rarely slip from awareness for very long; furthermore, McNally reminds us, failure to think about traumas--such as early sexual abuse--must not be confused with amnesia or an inability to remember them. In fact, the evidence for repressed memories of trauma--or even for repression at all--is surprisingly weak.</p><p>A magisterial work of scholarship, panoramic in scope and nonpartisan throughout, this unfailingly lucid work will prove indispensable to anyone seeking to understand how people remember trauma.</p></p><p>Richard J. McNally is Professor of Psychology and Director of Clinical Training at Harvard University.&#x201c;Here we have the most comprehensive and sober treatment yet undertaken of this sensitive and provocative topic. From the clinic to the laboratory, from psychotherapy to cognitive science, McNally considers the broad and often discordant literature about how people remember and forget traumatic experiences. The result is a masterly review of the evidence that will be an essential resource for mental health professionals, social workers, lawyers, and scientists interested in the psychological effects of trauma.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Larry R. Squire, University of California School of Medicine, San Diego</b><br><br>&#x201c;Richard McNally has given us an incisive, lucid and remarkably comprehensive review and analysis of the conditions that produce lasting memories of traumatic experiences.

Can memories of terrible experiences be repressed only to be recovered at a later date? Richard McNally draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of evidence from cognitive, behavioral, and neuroscience to answer these troubling questions, among the most difficult ever faced by psychologists, psychotherapists, and families. Anyone who wants to go behind the headlines and polemics about repressed memories will be enthralled by this book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David H. Barlow, Boston University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Richard McNally calls this theory of amnesia "psychiatric folklore." As a therapist and a professor of psychology at Harvard, he has spent years studying the effects of trauma on people's mental processes--including memory. He is on top of the research and has done some of it himself. The investigational literature is vast, and <i>Remembering Trauma</i> covers virtually all of it...Elegant and impassioned.

McNally has set a standard for application of experimental and observational data to notions and hypotheses about memory and trauma. The book informs the current public and professional debates, clarifies battling ideologies, and avoids the 'political correctness' that has been so damaging to scientific inquiry. The reader, whether lay or professional, will emerge more knowledgeable and more skeptical of many scientific and clinical assertions about memory and particularly amnesia.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Glenn Craig Davis</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[McNally] addresses all of the relevant data, including those studies heralded as definitive by proponents of repressed memory.

Stating that this is about how success can be achieved for ordinary people through doing the right things, Thomas ruminates on a variety of topics organized under chapters entitled Faith, Discipline, Caring, Teamwork, Support, Leadership, etc. When Thomas talks about Wendy operations (for example, instead of hiring a costly market research firm to test-market a proposed taco salad, the company merely purchased chili ladles and taco chips and began selling the salads, which became a popular menu item) or discusses other aspects of his busy life (a recent operation for a benign tumor), the prose moves swiftly. But reflections and thoughts about various individuals (such as a network producer who adopted a teenager) are too short and uninvolving to make much of a mark. This is a somewhat bland mishmash of thoughts and stories penned by a successful businessperson who seems much more personable in his television advertisements. Nevertheless, because of Thomas' successful track record, this will attract readers interested in learning more about what Thomas perceives as the skills, attitudes, and values shared by successful people. <i>Sue-Ellen Beauregard</i>It is quite possible that thousands of years from now, forensic cultural criticism will determine that motivational speaking and inspirational books acted upon our minds in much the same way as lead poisoning acted upon the minds of the citizens of the latter Roman Empire. First, it killed brain cells; then it killed a civilization. Now Dave (that's what he wants to be called) would take issue with this and claim that he's just offering some simple, hard-won, home-spun talk about God, honesty, and the spiritual nourishment of fast food. It's not that Dave's advice is stupid (though it is simple), and it's not that Dave's a bad guy (lotta talk about charity). It's that Dave is selling hamburgers. Now that's okay (unless you're a cow), but a cash-register makes a poor pulpit. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Angel, you're here!" Bliss Mackay jumped up from the large towel she was lying on and ran to the young woman making her way along the grassy bank from the marina store.<br><br> She carried a pizza box and a cooler full of drinks toward Bliss and the teenagers. Beyond Angel, through the large glass window of the store, Bliss could see her parents, Chaya and Natches, watching. And Bliss could see the frown on her mother's face and the confusion on her father's.<br><br> Behind her, her cousins Annie, Laken, and Erin stood up from their own towels, all of them hurrying to meet the young woman at the wooden picnic table beneath the shade of a large dogwood tree.<br><br> "I have arrived," Angel agreed, the smile that lit up her face much different than the one she always gave the adults.<br><br> It wasn't the pizza that caused Bliss and her cousins to greet Angel so enthusiastically, though. It was Angel herself. She liked to talk about girly stuff, even though she wasn't the least bit girly. But she could talk about fixing cars and motorcycles and show the girls how to protect themselves and fend off the sometimes too-excited boys that decided they wanted more than just a kiss.<br><br> She knew cool stuff. Like what a desert wind felt like, or the scent of a jungle and how the smell of the different blooms would only tease and make a person want to smell it more. She had been places and seen things Bliss only dreamed of going and seeing.<br><br> As Angel placed the food and drinks on the table and turned to them, Bliss threw her arms around her in a tight hug, knowing the pizza must mean Angel would be leaving, if not today then the next morning. And she couldn't help but hold on tighter for a moment as she made herself hold back all the things she wanted to say.<br><br> "I'm going to miss you so much," Angel whispered a second before she pulled back. She hugged the other girls and said the same thing.<br><br> Even though she said the same thing to her cousins, Bliss knew Angel meant the words more for her than the others. She knew it and couldn't say anything because she was never certain why. It was just a truth that was there, like she and Angel were best friends all their lives, despite their eight-year age difference.<br><br> "I'm starting to hate pizza," the youngest girl, Erin, sighed as they all sat at the table. "It always means you're going to leave."<br><br> "Yeah, we hate it when you leave, Angel," Annie, older than Bliss by a few weeks, agreed as she glanced away for a moment.<br><br> "It won't be for long," Angel promised, but Bliss saw the sadness in her eyes. "I'll be back."<br><br> That didn't mean they'd get to see her. Bliss had overheard her mother telling her father how she didn't trust Angel. She thought Angel was hiding too many secrets.<br><br> She might be, Bliss thought at the time, but her mom didn't have to know everything about everyone. Sometimes people liked to keep their secrets.<br><br> Bliss was silent as she ate a slice of the pizza and sipped at the iced tea Angel had brought.<br><br> "Angel, you should talk to Dad and get hired on with the police," Erin stated as they finished their pizza. "I heard Sam Bryce telling Dad he should ask you about it."<br><br> Bliss saw Angel's surprise before she gave a roll of her eyes.<br><br> "Sam probably just wants to flirt with her." Annie giggled. "She told Aunt Zoey that Angel was hot."<br><br> "Good God," Angel muttered, frowning a little as she brushed back the front of her hair in the same way Bliss often saw her mom do when she was really nervous. "That woman scares even me."<br><br> Bliss laughed at the comment. Sam was really attractive, and Bliss had overheard several of Aunt Zoey's friends talking about how "tempting" she could be.<br><br> Bliss had overheard another conversation, too. One where her mom had told Erin's dad, the chief of police, that someone needed to find out what Angel was hiding.<br><br> There was no way Uncle Alex would hire Angel, even if she wanted to work there.<br><br> "I'd get arrested if I tried to work with Sam Bryce," Angel assured them all. "I'd end up shooting her just because she can be so irritating."<br><br> It was a friendly threat, but one that assured Bliss that Angel had no intentions of working on the police force.<br><br> "Sam's fun," Laken assured her. "She told Dad to suck her dick the other day and made him blush all the way to the roots of his hair. Mom was laughing so hard I thought she was going to bust a gut or something."<br><br> They were all laughing then. They had all heard the comment, watched Uncle Dawg rub at the back of his neck, mutter something about damned smart-assed women, then stalk away. Even Bliss's mom and dad had laughed at it.<br><br> The conversation flowed around the table until several girls from school drew her cousins' attention and they excused themselves to go talk to them. Bliss stayed, staring down at the pizza she hadn't finished and wishing it didn't hurt so bad to tell Angel good-bye.<br><br> "Everything okay, Bliss?" Angel asked her, her voice softer and echoing with something Bliss just didn't understand.<br><br> "You're going to go fight again," Bliss muttered, shooting Angel an accusing look. "That's what you do, isn't it? You get paid to fight other people's wars."<br><br> Angel looked confused, hurt. "I didn't lie to you, Bliss. I get paid to rescue people. Sometimes those people are caught in other people's wars, but it's not the war I'm fighting."<br><br> Bliss clenched her teeth for a moment, feeling angry, sad, and fed up with how angry her mother always stayed with Angel.<br><br> "Why don't you just tell my mom whatever it is she wants to know so she'll stop being so worried about us being friends?" she demanded. "I don't make friends easy, Angel. I don't want to lose one."<br><br> That was her fear. That one day, Angel just wouldn't come back because Bliss's mom would forbid it.<br><br> Surprise flashed in Angel's eyes, the blue contacts she wore giving her gaze an oddly shattered appearance. Her mom was right; Angel hid too much of herself and who she was, even for Bliss's comfort.<br><br> "Telling your momma my secrets wouldn't do anything to help the situation, Bliss." Angel looked away and brushed back the front of her hair again, even though it hadn't yet fallen around her eyes.<br><br> Breathing out hard Angel drew the knife from the sheath at her belt and began cutting up the empty pizza box so it would fit easily in the mouth of the trash can.<br><br> It was the knife that silenced Bliss's protests.<br><br> All she could do was stare at it, her entire world centering on that knife. The bone handle, weathered with age and the many hands it had passed through. Silver capped the bone, untarnished and gleaming from the constant handling and careful polishing. It was the blade that had her heart racing in her chest, had her wanting to scream, to deny, to demand explanations.<br><br> Because as Angel paused, holding the knife against the cardboard, the inscription on the blade jumped out and seared her brain:<br><br> Godspeed<br><br> It was right there, a little darker in the grooves, easy to read, impossible to deny.<br><br> "My momma told me once that sometimes it was her job to worry and my job to let her do it." The words beat Bliss's brain when Angel uttered them.<br><br> "Sometimes, it's just my job to worry, Bliss, and your job to let me do it." Her mother's lips curved with a hint of sadness. "And every day I just pray that if I worry enough, I won't lose you, like I lost Beth. . . ."<br><br> Oh God.<br><br> A cold chill swept over her, almost causing her to shudder. It was even worse than the one she'd felt the other day when she'd seen her friend Bran getting yelled at by someone in another language, so angrily.<br><br> Angel was still talking. The knife was moving, but she couldn't take her eyes off it. Because she'd seen it before in pictures. She'd heard about it, been told the history of it, and she was certain it was the same knife her mother had given to her first daughter, Beth, before her mother had to leave Beth to go to Iraq so long ago.<br><br> The way Angel brushed her hair back when she was nervous . . . Bliss remembered the tears that fell from her mom's eyes when she told her about how Beth did that so much that she'd bought bows to pin back her hair.<br><br> The way Angel sometimes moved when an unfamiliar sound caught her attention . . .<br><br> The same way Bliss's mom moved when the same thing happened . . .<br><br> Angel always wore contacts, kept her hair colored. She was always angry whenever Mom would ask her about her parents. . . .<br><br> The scars Angel had on the back of one hand, so fine they were almost invisible. When Bliss asked about them, Angel told her she'd gotten them when she was three and her father and sister had been killed. . . .<br><br> Oh God, she didn't know what to do, didn't know what to say.<br><br> How was she supposed to keep this to herself?<br><br> "Bliss, are you okay?" Angel asked, pulling the knife back, pushing it into the sheath at her belt. "You aren't saying anything."<br><br> Concern filled Angel's voice.<br><br> Bliss could only shake her head. "You're my best friend," she whispered. "You should talk to Mom. . . ." She was screaming inside, so scared she was wrong, so certain she was right.<br><br> "We don't have anything to talk about, Bliss," Angel said then, but Bliss saw all the pain, and even anger, that filled her gaze. "My secrets aren't her business. But they don't endanger you. I'd never allow that."<br><br> "Bliss!" The sound of her mom's voice had Bliss jerking around to see her mother bearing down on them, her expression holding that "all business" look she could get. "Your father needs your help."<br><br> Bliss jumped to her feet and ran to her mother. She knew her mom, knew how she could get, how protective she was. She caught up with her before she could step to the grass, where Angel would hear what was said even if Bliss whispered.<br><br> "Mom." She stopped in front of her mother, seeing it now, how much Angel looked like her mother. The contacts and hair color fooled people. They stared at her eyes, not her face, Bliss realized. "If you really, really love me, Mom, you won't be mean to her. Please, Mom. Please. Not this time."<br><br> Her mother stared down at her then, her expression softening even as her lips thinned.<br><br> "Your dad needs help in the store, Bliss, before Uncle Rowdy and Aunt Kelly get here." Her voice lowered. "Tell your friend good-bye now and we'll both go help him."<br><br> A reprieve. It was just a reprieve and Bliss knew it, but it might give her time to figure this out, time to keep her mother from making a horrible mistake.<br><br> Turning, she saw Angel had risen, and she was staring back at Bliss's mother with that same determined expression, but in Angel's eyes Bliss saw the need and the anger. And she had no idea what to do.<br><br> Moving back to the picnic table and drawing Angel's attention once again, she saw the pain, the hope, and the fears that filled her eyes now more clearly than she ever had before.<br><br> "Don't leave," Bliss demanded, certain that if Angel left then she'd lose her nerve for sure.<br><br> "I'll be back, Bliss." She glanced over her shoulder, her expression flickering with regret.<br><br> Bliss knew Angel wouldn't be back soon, though, and there was no way to hold her there.<br><br> "I love you, Angel," she said, knowing now why she loved the other woman, but the shock, the fear that lit Angel's eyes broke her heart. "You're my best friend. Always. And I love you."<br><br> She threw her arms around Angel in a tight, fierce hug. She couldn't let her leave without telling her. Not now. Not now that she knew.<br><br> Angel returned the hug and in it, Bliss was terribly afraid she felt good-bye. If Angel left, she might never come back. . . .<br><br> Trudging back to her mother, Bliss avoided her eyes, but she couldn't avoid the truth. The truth that somehow, for some reason, someone had told her mother a terrible lie. The lie that her first daughter was dead. Because Beth Dane wasn't dead, she was Angel.<br><br> Two<br><br> Parking the motorcycle in front of the marina less than twenty-four hours later, Angel forced herself to dismount slowly and wait as her foster brothers, Tracker and Chance, did the same.<br><br> It was nearly impossible when panic was searing her insides. The news that Bliss had nearly been abducted had shaken her to her core. Another hour and she would have been on the plane heading for Rio, away from the teenager. Away from her sister.<br><br> Bliss could have been taken, dead before Angel could get back to her.<br><br> Releasing her helmet and pulling it off, she looked around, matching the appearance of mild concern exhibited by her foster brothers, holding back her fear. It was the greatest test of her patience and training as she pushed back the instinctive need to run, to race, to hurry, and to make certain Bliss and her mother were safe.<br><br> Tracker led the way to the marina's store, then to the office where the Mackay family had gathered. Angel stepped inside, her gaze locking on Natches and Chaya Mackay where they stood across the room with their daughter, Bliss.<br><br> Anger and suspicion immediately flared in Chaya's already-hard expression and cold brown eyes as her husband merely stared back curiously, though his emerald gaze was flat.<br><br> Merciless. A Marine sniper's eyes.<br><br> "Angel!" a voice shrieked, still filled with adrenaline. The teenager that called out to her drew her gaze from the couple. It was Rowdy's daughter, Annie, who saw her first and announced her presence. "I thought you were leaving."<br><br> Bliss swung away from her parents at Annie's cry, her emerald green eyes widening with relief as she followed Annie and rushed to her.<br><br> "We were on our way to the plane when I heard the report that Bliss was in trouble, so I thought I'd come check on you first." As she spoke, Annie, Laken, Bliss, and Erin were throwing their arms around her in one of those group hugs they'd perfected and Angel so enjoyed.</p><h2>The Fencing Master</h2><p>The unstoppable thrust is the arcane fencing technique known only by Don Jaime&#x2014;and the deadly maneuver that a beautiful young woman wants him to teach her.What begins as a rather bold request leads Don Jaime into the shadowy politics and violence of mid-nineteenth-century Madrid.<br></p><p>In <i>The Club Dumas</i>, Arturo P�rez-Reverte explored the labyrinthine world of antiquarian book dealers, spicing his tale of mystery and murder with characters straight out of <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>The Three Musketeers</i>. Next came <i>The Flanders Panel</i>, a brilliant puzzle comprised of art, chess, and untimely death whose resolution lies in a painting by a Flemish master. In <i>The Seville Communion</i>, P�rez-Reverte turned his sights on the tangled politics of the Roman Catholic Church as an appropriate backdrop--for murder. In his fourth novel translated into English, the Spanish writer changes centuries (if not his focus on homicide), returning to the mid-1800s to follow the exploits of Don Jaime Astarloa, the eponymous fencing master. <p> The year is 1866 and revolution is brewing in Spain. The corrupt Bourbon queen, Isabella II, is slowly losing her grip on power as equally corrupt exiled politicians vie to be her successor in a new republic. Against this background of political upheaval, Don Jaime goes about his business, teaching a dying art to a dwindling number of students. This is a man who resists changing times; to a friend he explains, "I have spent my whole life trying to preserve a certain idea of myself, and that is all. You have to cling to a set of values that do not depreciate with time. Everything else is the fashion of the moment, fleeting, mutable. In a word, nonsense." But then Adela de Otero--a woman with a mysterious past and an amazing talent for swordplay--comes into his life, and Don Jaime's world is turned upside down. As always, P�rez-Reverte offers literary excellence, a thumping good mystery, and fascinating insight into an arcane practice, in this case, fencing. Though the 19th-century politics in the book may resonate more with a Spanish audience than with English readers, the moral at the heart of <i>The Fencing Master</i> is universal: "to be honest, or at least honorable--anything, indeed, that has its roots in the word <i>honor</i>." In this, Don Jaime and Arturo P�rez-Reverte both succeed. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Published in paperback by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-600684-7<br>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 1999, 0-15-100181-2<br></p><h2>Mystery in the Minster (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)</h2><p><p><b>For the twentieth anniversary of the start of the Matthew Bartholomew series, Sphere is delighted to reissue all of the medieval monk's cases with beautiful new series-style covers.</b></p><p><b>------------------------------------</b><br><b></b><br><b>The seventeenth chronicle in the Matthew Bartholomew series.</b></p><p>In 1358 the fledging college of Michaelhouse in Cambridge is in need of extra funds.

Silkwood was a union activist concerned about health and safety issues at the plant, and her death at age twenty-eight was considered by many to be highly suspicious. Was it Kerr-McGee's revenge on a troublesome whistle-blower? Or was it part of a much larger conspiracy reaching from the Atomic Energy Commission to the FBI and the CIA?</p><p>Richard Rashke leads us through the myriad of charges and countercharges, theories and facts, and reaches conclusions based solely on the evidence in hand. Originally published in 1981, his book offers a vivid, edgy picture of the tensions that racked this country in the 1970s. However, the volume is not only an important historical document. Complex, fascinating characters populate this compelling insider's view of the nuclear industry. The issues it explores&#x2015;whistle-blowers, worker safety, the environment, and nuclear vulnerability&#x2015;have not lost relevance today, twenty-six years after Silkwood's white Honda Civic was found trapped in a concrete culvert near Oklahoma City.</p><p>For this second edition, Rashke has added a Preface and three short chapters that explore what has been learned about Silkwood since the book's original publication, explain what happened to the various actors in the drama, and discuss the long-term effects of the events around Silkwood's death.</p></p><p><p>Richard Rashke lives in Washington, D.C. He has written several plays and screenplays, and his books include Escape from Sobibor and Runaway Father.

This book examines, at local and international level, all aspects of the subject - historical, agricultural, and botanical; chemical and technological commercial and economic; indigo&#39;s various uses in textiles and its many sociological, medicinal, folkloric, and other connotations. It pays particular attention to indigo&#39;s history as a trade commodity, including its commercial exploitation by the European colonial powers. The author examines the different plant sources and compares production and dyeing methods used in different cultures. The various patterning techniques used with indigo on a wide range of textiles are described, as are some uses of the dyestuff in traditional medicine and religious practices. The book also looks at the modern application of indigo, not least its continuing sartorial appeal, particularly in ever-popular blue denim, and its use by textile arts and craftsmen.</p><p></p><h2>Stories of Mermaids (Usborne Young Reading)</h2><p>Collects three tales about mermaids--one who is poor and must steal to save her mother, one who solves a crime, and one who is willing to give up her tail for love.</p><p></p><h2>Fine Woodworking on Marquetry and Veneer</h2><p><p>Beautiful wood is precious and has to be used sparingly.

Here Taylor talks in detail about thinkers who are his allies and interlocutors, such as Iris Murdoch, Alasdair MacIntyre, Robert Brandom, and Paul Celan. He offers major contributions to social theory, expanding on the issues of nationalism, democratic exclusionism, religious mobilizations, and modernity. And he delves even more deeply into themes taken up in <i>A Secular Age</i>: the continuity of religion from the past into the future; the nature of the secular; the folly of hoping to live by &#x201c;reason alone&#x201d;; and the perils of moralism. He also speculates on how irrationality emerges from the heart of rationality itself, and why violence breaks out again and again.</p><p>In <i>A Secular Age</i>, Taylor more evidently foregrounded his Catholic faith, and there are several essays here that further explore that faith. Overall, this is a hopeful book, showing how, while acknowledging the force of religion and the persistence of violence and folly, we nonetheless have the power to move forward once we have given up the brittle pretensions of a narrow rationalism.</p></p><p>Charles Taylor is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy at McGill University and author of influential books including <i>Sources of the Self, The Ethics of Authenticity,</i> and <i>A Secular Age</i>. He has received many honors, including the Templeton Prize, the Berggruen Prize, and membership in the Order of Canada.&#x201c;Charles Taylor is one of the finest thinkers we have. And by &#x2018;we&#x2019; I mean every striving, puzzled, intellectually alert person on the planet. Even when you dissent from his conclusions you&#x2019;d be a dullard if you chose to ignore Taylor&#x2019;s verve or the fabulous intellectual tussles his writings provoke. Mostly, you&#x2019;ll find yourself agreeing with him and I can think of no better introduction to either pursuit (the cheering or the respectful booing) than this splendid book... The wisdom and learning on display is staggering.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Wright</b><b>, </b><b><i>Catholic Herald</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Charles Taylor&#x2019;s worldwide influence and reputation owe to the depth and imagination of his work. They owe, too, to the fact that he is one of the few philosophers who has consistently made his ideas accessible to different philosophical traditions, as well as to scholars in other disciplines. His range of interests and reference is impressively wide and his writing is accessible and bracingly free of jargon. He is almost temperamentally incapable of writing on any subject without relating it to the most fundamental philosophical questions. He is generous when writing of others, drawing out what is most significant in their work, with never an unfair or unforgiving note. He has a keen and constantly curious cosmopolitan sensibility. Above all, his humanity is vast.

In 1918 came the brief moment when the victorious Allies at the Versailles Conference had the opportunity - by means of a peace with justice - to set up democracy in central Europe. The Kings Depart tells of their failure; of the Allies&#39; rapacity which drove a ruined Germany to seek vengeance; of Germany&#39;s terrible collapse into anarchy and Red revolution and her even more frightful salvation at the hands of the army and the Freikorps; of the appearance of the swastika banner and right-wing terrorists and adventurers awaiting their Fuhrer.</p><p>Richard M Watt is the author of DARE CALL IT TREASON, a widely acclaimed history of the French Army mutinies in 1917.

When my cell phone rang and I glanced at the screen and saw it was Marina, I was studying the burgeoning clematis unfolding its fragile pink buds, giving birth to a riot of color, encouraged by its sunny midwife.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Ma, how are you?&#x201d; I said, hoping she could hear the sun&#x2019;s warmth in my voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, I . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Marina paused, and in that instant I knew something was dreadfully wrong. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, there&#x2019;s no other way to tell you this, but your father had a heart attack here at home yesterday afternoon, and in the early hours of this morning, he . . . passed away.&#x201d;<br> <br>I remained silent as a million different and ridiculous thoughts passed through my mind. The first one being that Marina, for some unknown reason, had decided to play some form of a tasteless joke on me.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the first of the sisters I&#x2019;ve told, Maia, as you&#x2019;re the eldest. And I wanted to ask you whether you would prefer to tell the rest of your sisters yourself, or leave it to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Still no words would form coherently on my lips, as I began to realize that Marina, dear, beloved Marina, the woman who had been the closest thing to a mother I&#x2019;d ever known, would never tell me this if it weren&#x2019;t true. So it had to be. And at that moment, my entire world shifted on its axis.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, please, tell me you&#x2019;re all right. This really is the most dreadful phone call I&#x2019;ve ever had to make, but what else could I do? God only knows how the other girls are going to take it.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was then that I heard the suffering in her voice and understood she&#x2019;d needed to tell me as much for her own sake as mine. So I switched into my normal comfort zone, which was to comfort others.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;ll tell my sisters if you&#x2019;d prefer, Ma, although I&#x2019;m not positive where they all are. Isn&#x2019;t Ally away training for a regatta?&#x201d;<br> <br>And, as we continued to discuss where each of my younger sisters was, as though we needed to get them together for a birthday party rather than to mourn the death of our father, the entire conversation took on a sense of the surreal.<br> <br>&#x201c;When should we plan on having the funeral, do you think? What with Electra being in Los Angeles and Ally somewhere on the high seas, surely we can&#x2019;t think about it until next week at the earliest,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well&#x201d;&#x2014;I heard the hesitation in Marina&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;&#x201c;perhaps the best thing is for you and I to discuss it when you arrive back home. There really is no rush now, Maia, so if you&#x2019;d prefer to continue the last couple of days of your holiday in London, that would be fine. There&#x2019;s nothing more to be done for him here . . .&#x201d; Her voice trailed off miserably.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma, of course I&#x2019;ll be on the next flight that I can get to Geneva! I&#x2019;ll call the airline immediately and let you know what time the flight is. And in the meantime, I&#x2019;ll do my best to get in touch with everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so terribly sorry, ch�rie,&#x201d; Marina sighed. &#x201c;I know how you adored him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, the strange calm that I had felt while we discussed arrangements suddenly deserting me like the stillness before a violent thunderstorm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you later, when I know what time I&#x2019;ll be arriving.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the meantime, please take care of yourself, Maia. You&#x2019;ve had a terrible shock.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pressed the button to end the call and before the storm clouds in my heart opened up and drowned me, I went upstairs to my bedroom to retrieve my flight documents and contact the airline. As I waited in the calling queue, I glanced at the bed where I&#x2019;d woken up that morning to simply another day. And I thanked God that human beings don&#x2019;t have the power to see into the future.<br> <br>The officious woman who eventually answered wasn&#x2019;t helpful and I knew, as she spoke of full flights, financial penalties, and credit card details, that my emotional dam was ready to burst. Finally, once I&#x2019;d been grudgingly granted a seat on the four o&#x2019;clock flight to Geneva, which would mean throwing everything into my luggage immediately and taking a taxi to Heathrow, I sat down on the bed and stared for so long at the sprigged wallpaper that the pattern began to dance in front of my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; I whispered, &#x201c;gone forever. I&#x2019;ll never see him again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Expecting the spoken words to provoke a raging torrent of tears, I was surprised that nothing actually happened. Instead, I sat there numbly, my head still full of practicalities. The thought of telling my sisters&#x2014;all five of them&#x2014;was horrendous and I searched through my emotional filing system for the one I would call first. Inevitably, it was Tiggy, the second youngest of the six of us girls and the sibling to whom I&#x2019;d always felt closest.<br> <br>With trembling fingers, I scrolled down to find her number and dialed it. When her voice mail answered, I didn&#x2019;t know what to say, other than a few garbled words asking her to call me back urgently. She was currently somewhere in the Scottish Highlands working at a center for orphaned and sick wild deer.<br> <br>As for the other sisters . . . I knew their reactions would vary, outwardly at least, from indifference to a dramatic outpouring of emotion.<br> <br>Given that I wasn&#x2019;t currently sure quite which way I would go on the scale of grief when I did speak to any of them, I decided to take the coward&#x2019;s way out and texted them all, asking them to call me as soon as they could. Then I hurriedly packed my luggage and walked down the narrow stairs to the kitchen to write a note for Jenny explaining why I&#x2019;d had to leave in such a hurry.<br> <br>Deciding to take my chances hailing a black cab on the London streets, I left the house, walking briskly around the leafy Chelsea crescent just as any normal person would do on any normal day. I believe I actually said hello to someone walking a dog when I passed him in the street and managed a smile.<br> <br>No one would know what had just happened to me, I thought as I managed to find a taxi on the busy King&#x2019;s Road and climbed inside it, directing the driver to Heathrow.<br> <br>Nobody would know.<br> <br><br> <br>Five hours later, just as the sun was making its leisurely descent over Lake Geneva, I arrived at our private pontoon on the shore, from where I would make the last leg of my journey home.<br> <br>Christian was already waiting for me in our sleek Riva motor launch. And from the look on his face, I could see he&#x2019;d heard the news.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you, Mademoiselle Maia?&#x201d; he asked, sympathy in his blue eyes as he helped me aboard.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m . . . glad I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; I answered neutrally as I walked to the back of the boat and sat down on the cushioned cream leather seat that curved around the stern. Usually, I would sit with Christian in the passenger seat at the front as we sped across the calm waters on the twenty-minute journey home. But today, I felt a need for privacy. As Christian started the powerful engine, the sun glinted off the windows of the fabulous houses that lined Lake Geneva&#x2019;s shores. I&#x2019;d often felt when I made this journey that it was the entrance to an ethereal world disconnected from reality.<br> <br>The world of Pa Salt.<br> <br>I noticed the first vague evidence of tears pricking at my eyes as I thought of my father&#x2019;s pet name, which I&#x2019;d coined when I was young. He&#x2019;d always loved sailing and often when he returned to me at our lakeside home, he had smelled of fresh air and the sea. Somehow, the name had stuck, and as my younger siblings had joined me, they&#x2019;d called him that too.<br> <br>As the launch picked up speed, the warm wind streaming through my hair, I thought of the hundreds of previous journeys I&#x2019;d made to Atlantis, Pa Salt&#x2019;s fairy-tale castle. Inaccessible by land, due to its position on a private promontory with a crescent of mountainous terrain rising up steeply behind it, the only method of reaching it was by boat. The nearest neighbors were miles away along the lake, so Atlantis was our own private kingdom, set apart from the rest of the world. Everything it contained within it was magical . . . as if Pa Salt and we, his daughters, had lived there under an enchantment.<br> <br>Each one of us had been chosen by Pa Salt as a baby, adopted from one of the four corners of the globe, and brought home to live under his protection. And each one of us, as Pa always liked to say, was special, different . . . we were his girls. He&#x2019;d named us all after the Seven Sisters, his favorite star cluster. I was Maia, being the first and eldest.<br> <br>When I was young, he&#x2019;d take me up to his glass-domed observatory perched on top of the house; lift me up with his big, strong hands; and have me look through his telescope at the night sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;There they are,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say as he aligned the lens, &#x201c;look, Maia, and see the beautiful shining star you&#x2019;re named after.&#x201d;<br> <br>And I would see. As he explained the legends that were the source of my own and my sisters&#x2019; names, I&#x2019;d hardly listen but simply enjoy his arms tight around me, fully aware of this rare, special moment when I had him all to myself.<br> <br>Marina, whom I&#x2019;d presumed as I grew up was my mother&#x2014;I&#x2019;d even shortened her name to &#x201c;Ma&#x201d;&#x2014;I&#x2019;d realized eventually was a glorified nursemaid, employed by Pa to take care of me, because he was away so much. But of course, Marina was so much more than that to all of us girls. She was the one who had wiped our tears, berated us for sloppy table manners, and steered us calmly through the difficult transition from childhood to womanhood.<br> <br>She had always been there, and I could not have loved Ma any more if she had given birth to me.<br> <br>During the first three years of my childhood, Marina and I had lived alone together in our magical castle on the shores of Lake Geneva as Pa Salt traveled the seven seas to conduct his business. And then, one by one, my sisters began to arrive.<br> <br>Usually, Pa would bring me a present when he returned home. I&#x2019;d hear the motor launch arriving, run across the sweeping lawns and through the trees to the jetty to greet him. Like any child, I&#x2019;d want to see what he had hidden inside his magical pockets to delight me. On one particular occasion, however, after he&#x2019;d presented me with an exquisitely carved wooden reindeer, which he assured me came from Saint Nicholas&#x2019;s workshop at the North Pole itself, a uniformed woman had stepped out from behind him, and in her arms was a bundle wrapped in a shawl. And the bundle was moving.<br> <br>&#x201c;This time, Maia, I&#x2019;ve brought you back the most special gift. You have a new sister.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d smiled at me as he lifted me into his arms. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ll no longer be lonely when I have to go away.&#x201d;<br> <br>After that, life had changed. The maternity nurse who Pa had brought with him disappeared after a few weeks and Marina took over the care of my baby sister. I couldn&#x2019;t understand how the red, squalling thing which often smelled and diverted attention from me could possibly be a gift. Until one morning, when Alcyone&#x2014;named after the second star of the Seven Sisters&#x2014;smiled at me from her high chair over breakfast.<br> <br>&#x201c;She knows who I am,&#x201d; I said in wonder to Marina, who was feeding her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course she does, Maia dear. You&#x2019;re her big sister, the one she&#x2019;ll look up to. It&#x2019;ll be up to you to teach her lots of things that you know and she doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>And as she grew, she became my shadow, following me everywhere, which pleased and irritated me in equal measure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, wait me!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d demand loudly as she tottered along behind me.<br> <br>Even though Ally&#x2014;as I&#x2019;d nicknamed her&#x2014;had originally been an unwanted addition to my dreamlike existence at Atlantis, I could not have asked for a sweeter, more loveable companion. She rarely, if ever, cried and when she was a toddler there were none of the temper tantrums associated with children of her age. With her tumbling red-gold curls and her big blue eyes, Ally had a natural charm that drew people to her, including our father. On the occasions Pa Salt was home from one of his long trips abroad, I&#x2019;d watch how his eyes lit up when he saw her, in a way I was sure they didn&#x2019;t for me. And whereas I was shy and reticent with strangers, Ally had an openness and trust that endeared her to everyone.<br> <br>She was also one of those children who seemed to excel at everything&#x2014;particularly music, and any sport to do with water. I remember Pa teaching her to swim in our vast pool, and whereas I had struggled to master the technique to stay afloat and hated being underwater, my little sister took to it like a mermaid. And while I struggled to find my sea legs even on the Titan, Pa&#x2019;s huge and beautiful oceangoing yacht, when we were at home, Ally would beg him to take her out in the small Laser dinghy he kept moored on our private lakeside jetty. I&#x2019;d crouch in the cramped stern of the boat while Pa and Ally took control as we sped across the glassy waters. Their joint passion for sailing bonded them in a way I felt I could never replicate.<br> <br>Although Ally had studied music at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gen�ve and was a highly talented flautist who could have pursued a career with a professional orchestra, since leaving music school she had chosen the life of a full-time sailor. She now competed regularly in regattas and had represented Switzerland on a number of occasions.<br> <br>When Ally was almost three, Pa arrived home with our next sibling, whom he named Asterope, after the third of the Seven Sisters.<br> <br>&#x201c;But we will call her Star,&#x201d; Pa had said, smiling at Marina, Ally, and me as we studied the newest addition to the family lying in the bassinet.<br> <br>By now I was attending lessons every morning with a private tutor, so my newest sister&#x2019;s arrival affected me less than Ally&#x2019;s had. Then, only six months later, another baby girl joined us, a twelve-week-old named Celaeno, whose name Ally immediately shortened to CeCe.<br> <br>There was only three months&#x2019; age difference between Star and CeCe, and from as far back as I can remember, the two of them forged a close bond. They were like twins, talking in their own private baby language, some of which the two of them still used to communicate. They inhabited their own private world, to the exclusion of us others, and even now, in their twenties, nothing had changed. CeCe, the younger of the two, was always the boss, her stocky body and nut-brown skin in direct contrast to the pale, whippet-thin Star.<br> <br>The following year, another baby arrived, Taygete&#x2014;whom I nicknamed &#x201c;Tiggy&#x201d; because her short, dark hair had sprouted out at strange angles on her tiny head and reminded me of the hedgehog in Beatrix Potter&#x2019;s famous story.<br> <br>I was by now seven years old, and I&#x2019;d bonded with Tiggy from the first moment I set eyes on her. She was the most delicate of us all, suffering one childhood illness after another, but even as an infant, she was stoic and undemanding. When yet another baby girl, named Electra, was brought home by Pa a few months later, an exhausted Marina would often ask me if I would mind sitting with Tiggy, who was continually suffering with a fever or croup. Eventually diagnosed as asthmatic, she rarely left the nursery to be wheeled outside in the pram, in case the cold air and heavy fog of a Geneva ...</p><h2>Raised from the Ground</h2><p>A multigenerational family saga that paints a sweeping portrait of twentieth-century Portugal<br><br>First published in 1980, the City of Lisbon Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Raised from the Ground</i> follows the changing fortunes of the Mau Tempo family&#x2014;poor landless peasants not unlike Saramago&#x2019;s own grandparents.

This book contains selections from the photographic collection of one Mell Kilpatrick, a news photographer from South California who relentlessly pursued his profession during the 40s and 50s, capturing images from the plentiful crime scenes and in particular automobile collisions that came his way. Kilpatrick was an obsessive witness to the effects of the post-war explosion of car culture in California, and through his lens he repeatedly viewed the fatal consequences of speed. technology and reckless abandon. His work might have remained lost and unknown, sealed away in his locked darkroom, untouched since his death in 1961, if it hadn&#39;t been brought to light by collector and dealer Jennifer Dumas, who Found the 5,000 negatives and realised she&#39;d stumbled upon something very special. Although he covered other &#39;stories&#39; apart from crashes, including shots of everyday life in the small towns he visited, it is the roadside images that dominate the collection. They are an unsparing archive of human tragedy. Picture after picture unveils yet another tableau of disaster with infinite variations -- the fragile shells of cars collapsed and upended, corpses hidden or fully revealed, stoic cops and laughing bystanders dealing in different ways with the reality of sudden death. It is this combination of the banal or ordinary and the appalling horror of the moment of impact that makes Kilpatrick&#39;s work a Fascinating experience.</p><p>Kilpatrick (1902^-62) was basically a working stiff who held down two jobs at once to support a growing family. He was a movie projectionist in the mid-1940s in California when he got a still camera and made himself invaluable to insurance companies and the highway patrol as a photographer of auto wrecks and later to the <i>Santa Ana Register</i> as a news photographer. Dumas' selection of his work concentrates on images of accident and death, including murders and suicides as well as highway fatalities. She speculates that Kilpatrick's pictures may have been influenced by the films noir he saw from the projection booth, but most were taken at night and required the spotlighting that produces their noirish chiaroscuro. In any event, presented one per black-bordered page, they are riveting--ghastly, to be sure, but not repulsive, like Joel Peter Witkin's tableaus featuring cadavers. Instead, they inspire awe, pity, and the humbling acknowledgment of mortality, just as the horrid medieval images of the crucified Christ were intended to do. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She spent her early years chasing (and being chased by) sheep and collecting snakes before her parents transported her to the city of Adelaideand the more genteel surroundings of Methodist Ladies College. Having graduated, Sara then became a nurse on her parents' urging (it was both feminine and genteel) and spent seventeen years planning and then effecting her escape.</p><p>That escape came in the form of a Ph.D. in early modern English history. Sara and nursing finally parted company after a lengthy time of bare tolerance, and she took up a position as senior lecturer in medieval European history at the Bendigo campus of the Victorian University of La Trobe. Finding the departmental politics of academic life as intolerable as the emotional rigours of nursing, Sara needed to find another escape.</p><p>This took the form of one of Sara's childhood loves - books and writing. Spending some years practising writing novels, HarperCollins Australia picked up one of Sara's novels, <i>BattleAxe</i> (published in North America as <i>The Wayfarer Redemption</i>), the first in the Tencendor series, and chose it as the lead book in their new fantasy line with immediate success. Since 1995 Sara has become Australia's leading fantasy author and one of its top novelists.

As the original King of the Exploitation Film, he has filled his movies with images of blood-sucking vampires, rampaging biker gangs, vigilante strippers, and abducting aliens, all while producing each of his four-hundred-plus films on a shoestring budget and making a profit on nearly every one. In the process, Corman became the role model for today&#x2019;s independent filmmaker. This guru with a vision has also demonstrated an uncanny eye for talent, being among the first to recognize and employ the abilities of Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Joe Dante, Ron Howard, John Sayles, and James Cameron to name but a few. Through interviews with eighty of Corman&#x2019;s friends and associates and photographs, Beverly Gray takes you behind the cameras and into the heart of Cormanville for a firsthand, insider&#x2019;s look at the man and the mogul, providing a compelling private and public perspective on this soft-spoken giant of the cinema.</p><p>Beverly Gray was story editor and development executive at Roger Corman&#x2019;s Concorde-New Horizons Pictures, collaborating on some 170 low-budget films.

Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style - thorough, yet riveting - famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century - from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.</p><p></p><h2>The Killing of Karen Silkwood</h2><p>Relates the intriguing conspiracy case and death of Karen Silkwood, a union activist deliberately contaminated with plutonium who subsequently died in a car accident en route to delivering corporate documents to a reporter</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<p>"Rashke's account of the massive documentation on the Silkwood case stands up to critical review. . .

He is now studying agricultural science at Melbourne University. <em>Clancy the Courageous Cow</em> is his first book.</p>Australian newcomer Hume's wry na�ve illustrations buoy this somewhat clunky story about a misfit cow, in which the explicit message about the importance of diversity overshadows the comedy. Clancy the cow is a "great disappointment for his parents. You see, they belonged to a herd of Belted Galloways, but Clancy had no belt. He was beltless." (Belted Galloways are black with a white band around the middle.) Clancy grows strong by slipping through the fence at night into the Herefords' lush field to graze (without a stripe, "he was invisible in the dark!"), and a <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> subplot emerges in which Clancy falls in love with a "totally brown" Hereford named Helga ("Like Clancy, Helga had always been picked on because she was different"). In the pasture war between the herds, the Herefords have the upper hoof until Clancy wins the wrestling match and proclaims, "I say we pull down the fence and be cows together." Hume's illustrations of the cartoon cows are often amusing. As an outcast, Clancy tries various silly remedies: he paints on a white stripe, sprinkles on white sugar and even rolls in the snow. When Clancy is being trained to fight by some experienced wrestlers, the spread features different cow-appropriate wrestling holds (the Cud Cruncher, the Helicowpter, the Ruminator, etc.). These comic touches leaven the rather heavy-handed message. All ages. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But he's about to change that tune . . .</p><p>It started off as a lark, a late-night jaunt from a boring party to the home of a psychic medium, with Jack dragged along as a reluctant participant. But as soon as Jack and Gia step across the threshold, the house and the earth itself shake to the accompaniment of a tortured scream.</p><p>Menelaus Manor sits atop a major geologic fault known as Cameron's Line. But that's not it's only problem. The house has a horrific history. Its original owner died of cancer; his son blew his brains out in the basement; the couple that bought it next were found dead in their bed with their throats slashed; shortly thereafter a child was horribly mutilated in an upstairs bedroom. </p><p>The current owners, Lyle and Charlie Kenton, clever practitioners of spiritualist hocus-pocus, use high-tech tricks to dupe their marks. Perhaps they're too good: they've lured too many clients from other mediums and are now under attack. Unable to go to the police for fear of exposing their own scams, they hire Repairman Jack to fix their problem.</p><p>Jack takes the job, figuring he'll straighten out the situation by engaging in one of his favorite pastimes: scamming a scammer. But soon he learns that this fix-it involves more than professional jealousy in the spook trade. The earthquake marked the awakening of something in Menelaus Manor, something that used to be someone, an entity full of rage and brought back for a specific purpose. </p><p>But this entity has an agenda all its own . . . </p><p>Before he's finished Jack will travel from the seamy world of psychic scams to the inner circle of a well-connected murder cult, and finally into the dark heart of madness where he must strike a deal with a rage-filed entity returned from the dead.</p></p><p><p><b>F.

You may.<br>A casual little get-together, Gia had told him. Some of her artist friends were going to gather at a loft in a converted warehouse on the fringe of the old Brooklyn Army Terminal, throw a little party for one of their clan who&#x2019;d started to make it big. Come on, she&#x2019;d said. It&#x2019;ll be fun.<br>Jack wasn&#x2019;t in a fun mood. Hadn&#x2019;t been for some time now. But he&#x2019;d agreed to go. For Gia.<br>Maybe twenty people wandering about the space while Pavement&#x2019;s last album pounded from a boom box, echoing off the high ceilings, huge windows, and stripped-to-the-brick walls.

He&#x2019;d brought his own, opting to forego his usual Rolling Rock long necks for a six-pack of Harp. Good thing, too. The bridal-bedecked hostess had stocked Bud Light.

I&#x2019;ve decided she just wants attention.<br>Is that so bad? Just because you&#x2019;re frightened to death of attention doesn&#x2019;t make it wrong for other people to court it.<br>Not frightened to death of it, Jack grumbled, not wanting to concede the point.<br>A tall, slim woman passed by then, a dead-white streak running along the side of her frizzy black swept-back hair.<br>He cocked his head toward her. I know her statement: her husband&#x2019;s a monster.<br>Karyn&#x2019;s not married.<br>A guy with gelled neon yellow hair slid by, each eyebrow pierced by at least a dozen gold rings.<br>Hi, Gia, he said with a wave and kept moving.<br>Hi, Nick.<br>Let me guess, Jack muttered. As a child Nick was frightened by a curtain rod.<br>My, aren&#x2019;t we the cranky one tonight, Gia said, giving him a look.<br>Cranky barely touched it. He&#x2019;d been alternating between bouts of rage and the way-down dumps for a couple of months now. Ever since Kate&#x2019;s death. Couldn&#x2019;t seem to pull himself out. He&#x2019;d been finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning, and once he was up, there didn&#x2019;t seem to be anything he wanted to do. So he&#x2019;d drag himself to Abe&#x2019;s or Julio&#x2019;s or Gia&#x2019;s and pretend he was fine. Same old Jack, just not working on anything at the moment.<br>The angry voice mail messages from his father, ragging on him for not showing up at Kate&#x2019;s wake or funeral, hadn&#x2019;t helped. <em>Don&#x2019;t tell me you had something more important to do. She was your</em> sister, <em>down it</em>!<br>Jack knew that. After fifteen years of separation, Kate had come back into his life for one week during which he&#x2019;d gotten to know her again, love her again, and now she was gone. Forever.<br>The facts said it wasn&#x2019;t Jack&#x2019;s fault, but the facts didn&#x2019;t keep Jack from blaming himself. And one other person...<br>He&#x2019;d searched for the man he&#x2019;d suspected of being in some way responsible, a man whose real name he didn&#x2019;t know but who&#x2019;d called himself Sal Roma once, and maybe Ms. Aralo too. He&#x2019;d put the word out but no one knew anything. Never heard of him. Jack wound up with a taste of his own medicine&#x2014;Sal Roma didn&#x2019;t seem to exist.<br>Kate...she might still be alive if only he&#x2019;d done things his way instead of listening to...<br>Stop. No point in traveling that well-worn trail again. He hadn&#x2019;t returned his father&#x2019;s calls. After a while they stopped.<br>He forced a smile for Gia. Sorry. Pseudo-weirdos crank me off.<br>Can&#x2019;t be much weirder than the people you spend most of your day with.<br>Those are different. They&#x2019;re real. Their weirdness comes from inside. They wake up weird. They dress weird because they reach out a hand and whatever it touches first is what they wear that day. These people here spend hours in front of a mirror making themselves look weird. My weirdos have hair that spikes out in twenty directions because that&#x2019;s the way it was when they rolled out of bed this morning; these folks use herbal shampoo, half a gallon of gel, and a special comb to achieve their unwashed bed-head look. My weirdos don&#x2019;t belong; these people seem to want desperately to belong, but don&#x2019;t want anyone to know, so they try to outdo each other to look like outsiders.<br>Gia&#x2019;s lips twisted. And the biggest outsider of them all is sitting right here in a short-sleeve plaid shirt, jeans, and work boots.<br>And spending the evening watching pretensions collide with affectations. Present company excluded, of course.<br>One of the many things he loved about Gia was her lack of affectation. Her hair was blond by nature and short for convenience. Tonight she was wearing beige slacks and a sleeveless turquoise top that heightened the blue of her eyes. Her makeup consisted of a touch of lipstick. She didn&#x2019;t need anything more. She looked clean and healthy, a very untrendy look in this subculture.<br>But the subculture had percolated into the overculture, the fringe had become mainstreamed. Years ago construction workers threw bricks at longhairs and called them faggots, now the building trades were packed with ponytails and earrings.<br>Maybe it&#x2019;s time I got myself adorned, Jack said.<br>Gia&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up. You mean pierced? You?<br>Well, yeah. Sometimes I feel like I stand out because I&#x2019;m not bejeweled and be-inked.<br>Be-inked?<br>You know&#x2014;tattooed.<br>Everyone seemed into it, and if he wanted to remain invisible, he&#x2019;d have to follow the crowd.<br>But nothing permanent, he added. Didn&#x2019;t want to lose his chameleon capabilities. Maybe a clip-on earring and one or two of those temporary tattoos.<br>Didn&#x2019;t you do something like that to your fingers once?<br>You remember those? Phony prison tats. With indelible ink. A one-time thing for a hairy job that left a couple of toughs from a Brighton Beach gang blazing mad and combing the five boroughs for a guy with HELL BENT tats on his knuckles. He hadn&#x2019;t been able to wash those off soon enough. No, I think I need something big and colorful.<br>How about a heart encircled with rose vines and GIA in its center?<br>I was thinking more on the order of a green skull with orange flames roaring out of its eye sockets.<br>Oh, how cool, Gia said, and sipped her wine.<br>Yeah. Slap that on one deltoid, maybe get a bright red Hot Stuff devil for the other, put on a tank top, and I&#x2019;ll be set.<br>Don&#x2019;t forget the earring.<br>Right. One of those dangly ones, maybe with the Metallica logo.<br>That&#x2019;s you, Jack. A speedmetal dude.<br>Jack sighed. Adorned...accessorized...I was brought up thinking that real men didn&#x2019;t bother with fashion.<br>So was I, Gia said. But I have an excuse: I grew up in semi-rural Iowa. You...you&#x2019;re a northeasterner.<br>True, but all the adult males I knew as a kid&#x2014;my father and the men he knew&#x2014;were plain dressers. Most had fought in Korea. They dressed up for things like weddings and funerals, but mostly they wore functional clothes. Nobody accessorized. You stayed in front of the mirror long enough to shave and comb the hair out of your eyes. Anything more and you were some sort of peacock.<br>Welcome to twenty-first-century Peacockville, Gia said.<br>Nick drifted by again.<br>What&#x2019;s Nick paint? Jack asked.<br>He doesn&#x2019;t paint. He&#x2019;s performance artist. His stage name is Harry Adamski.<br>Swell. Jack hated performance art. What&#x2019;s his performance?<br>Gia bit her upper lip. He calls it stool art. Let&#x2019;s just say it&#x2019;s a very personal form of sculpture and, um, let it go at that.<br>Jack stared at her. What was Gia&#x2014;?<br>Oh, jeez. Really...?<br>She nodded.<br>Christ, he said, letting loose, is there anything out there that <em>can&#x2019;t</em> claim it&#x2019;s an art? There&#x2019;s the art of war, the art of the deal, the art of the shoe shine, the Artist Formerly Known As Prince&#x2014;<br>I think he&#x2019;s back to calling himself Prince now.<br>&#x2014;the art of motorcycle maintenance. Smearing yourself with chocolate is art, hanging a toilet on a wall is art&#x2014;<br>Come on, Jack. Lighten up. I was hoping a night out would lift your spirits. You&#x2019;ve got to rejoin the living. Lately your life&#x2019;s consisted of eating, sleeping, and watching movies. You haven&#x2019;t worked out or taken a job or even returned calls. I&#x2019;m sure Kate wouldn&#x2019;t want you to spend the rest of your life moping around.<br>Jack knew Gia was right and looked away. He saw a willowy blonde in her mid twenties swaying in their direction. She carried a martini glass filled with reddish fluid, probably a cosmo. The bottom of her short, zebra-striped blouse did not meet the top of her low riding, skintight leopard miniskirt; in the interval a large diamond stud gleamed from her navel.<br>Maybe I should pierce my navel, Jack said.<br>Fine, but don&#x2019;t show me until you&#x2019;ve shaved your belly.<br>How about a pierced tongue?<br>Gia gave him a sidelong glance and a sultry smile. Now <em>that</em> could be interesting. She looked up and saw the blonde. Oh, here comes Junie Moon, the guest of honor.<br>That her real name?<br>Not sure. But that&#x2019;s the one she&#x2019;s used since I&#x2019;ve known her. She was struggling along just like the rest of us until Nathan Lane bought one of her abstracts last year and started talking her up. Now she&#x2019;s about as hot as you can get.<br>What&#x2019;s a Junie Moon original go for?<br>Twenty and up.<br>Jack blinked. Twenty thou?

Tolkein: A Biography</h2><p>The only authorised biography, and the only one written by an author who actually met J.R.R. Tolkien, with a redesigned cover to match the distinctive paperback editions of The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. In the 25 years since Tolkien&#39;s death in September 1973, millions have read The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books. Born in Bloemfontein in January 1892, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood, brought up in near-poverty and almost thwarted in adolescent romance. He served in the First World War, surviving the Battle of the Somme, where he lost some of his closest friends, and returned to academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at Oxford. Then suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while marking essay papers he found himself writing &#39;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit&#39; -- and worldwide renown awaited him. Humphrey Carpenter was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien&#39;s papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century&#39;s most cherished author.</p><p>There may be a corner of the world where the name J.R.R. Tolkien is unknown, but you would be hard-pressed to find it. Since their publication, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> have been published in every major language of the world. And though he single-handedly gave a mythology to the English and was beloved by millions, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien remained refreshingly unchanged by his fame and fortune, living out his days simply and modestly among the familiar surroundings of Oxford College. Humphrey Carpenter, who was given unrestricted access to Tolkien's papers, brilliantly puts meat to the bones of the Tolkien legend in <i>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography</i>, offering a well-rounded portrayal of this quiet, bookish man who always saw himself first and foremost as a philologist, uncovering rather than creating the peoples, languages, and adventures of Middle-Earth.<p> Carpenter chronicles Tolkien's early life with a special sensitivity; after losing both parents, Tolkien and his brother Hilary were taken from their idyllic life in the English countryside to a poverty-ridden existence in dark and sooty Birmingham. There were bright points, however. A social and cheerful lad, Tolkien enjoyed rugby and was proud of his gift for languages. It was also at this time that he met Edith Bratt, who would later become his wife. Academic life--both as a student and professor--is where this biography shines. Friendship with other men played a huge part in Tolkien's life, and Carpenter deftly reveals the importance these relationships--his complex friendship with C.S. Lewis, membership in the Inklings and the T.C.B.S.--had on the development of his writing.</p><p> The only criticism one can make about this book is that Carpenter tends to gloss over Tolkien's contributions to comparative philology. True, there is a chapter devoted to Tolkien's academic pursuits, but it tends to skim too lightly over the surface for this reviewer's tastes. Philology is a terribly methodical science, and the author clearly did not want to alienate readers who were primarily interested in Tolkien as a storyteller. Still, it would be nice to understand why Tolkien was held in such high esteem by his fellow academics. As it stands, Tolkien comes off as a slightly eccentric etymologist.</p><p> Fans who want to delve even deeper into Tolkien's life should pick up a copy of Carpenter's <i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>. <i>--P.M. Atterberry</i></p>Humphrey Carpenter was born in Oxford in 1946 and has spent most of his life in that city. He read English Language and Literature at Keble College, Oxford, and met Professor J.R.R. Tolkien on a number of occasions. For some years he worked for the BBC as a radio producer and broadcaster and has won acclaim as a top biographer, including the recent and controversial biography of Robert Runcie.</p><h2>Secret Societies: Illuminati, Freemasons, and the French Revolution</h2><p>The greatest success of the Bavarian Illuminati conspiracy was the French Revolution of 1789. The profound impact of that Revolution is felt to this day in the political destinies of billions of people worldwide. The Illuminati had declared war against Church and State a decade earlier and worked feverishly to spread their new gospel of Liberty and Reason. Although the Order was officially suppressed on the eve of the Revolution, its efforts do not appear to have been in vain. <p>The recruiting program of Illuminati founder Adam Weishaupt was focused on attracting the powerful and influential government ministers, educators, the press, authors and philosophers, booksellers and publishers, even religious leaders open to agnostic or atheist views. Many such men belonged to the masonic lodges of Germany, Austria, and France. The wider masonic network offered Weishaupt a respectable vehicle by which he was able to propagate his clandestine doctrines. </p><p>What message does the triumph of these secret societies carry for the modern world? English historian Una Birch attempts to answer this question from the point of view of the early twentieth century. Writing just a hundred years after the event, her closeness in time, and sympathy for the Revolution, offer a unique perspective to the modern reader. Editor James Wasserman adds a contemporary perspective that takes into account the events of the twentieth century that occurred after Ms. Birch wrote. He has also added a guide to the history and personalities of the French Revolution to help clarify the text. </p><p>* Reveals the secret activities of the Bavarian Illuminati and the Freemasons in organizing the French Revolution </p><p>* Traces the influence of the mysterious Illuminati agent, the Comte de Saint Germain, as he traveled through the courts and cities of Europe </p><p>* Offers a unique perspective on the Revolution by an author who supported the Illuminati war against tyranny and superstition, yet does not shrink from examining the darker side of that event</p></p><p><b>Una Birch</b> (1876-1949, later Dame Una Pope-Hennessy) was the author of numerous books on history and literature.

The normally lush, green countryside is in the grip of the worst drought in years: stunted cornstalks rasp in the hot July breeze, parched vegetable gardens wither and die, the Chittenden River shrinks to a trickle, and the drilling trucks are booked solid as one by one the wells give out. Patience Avery, known nationwide as a gifted &#34;water witch,&#34; is having a busy summer, too. Using the tools of the dowser&#39;s trade -- divining sticks, metal rods, bobbers, and pendulums -- she can locate, among other things, aquifers deep within the earth. In the midst of this crisis, Scottie Winston lobbies for permits to expand Powder Peak, a local ski area that&#39;s his law firm&#39;s principal client. As part of the expansion, the resort seeks to draw water for snowmaking from the beleaguered Chittenden, despite opposition from environmentalists who fear that the already weakened river will be damaged beyond repair. What ensues in Chris Bohjalian&#39;s fourth novel is a struggle between conservation and development, rugged tradition versus inevitable progress. But it is also a tale of the clash between science and mystery, a chronicle of one man&#39;s transformation from cynic to believer. Vivid with the texture of New England ways, alive with characters both quirky and real, informed by the ongoing, real-life battles between environmentalism and economic expansion in Vermont, Water Witches is a story of ineffable forces, tenuous balances, &#34;and perhaps something about our abilities as a people to heal and forgive and to love.&#34;</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim.

Shelley, however, enchanted him. In the months before his death at sea, he and Trelawny were frequent companions, and the young poet emerges from these pages in all his splendid carelessness and otherworldly concentration.</p><p><b>Edward John Trelawny</b> (1792-1881) was born into a well-established family from Cornwall. He passed a miserable childhood, and at the age of thirteen was enrolled by his father in the British navy. Discharged without a commission after a decade, Trelawny found his way to Italy, where he became part of the circle of expatriates around Byron and Shelley. He fought in the Greek War of Independence, during which he survived an assassination attempt, and wrote a notoriously unreliable but enormously successful autobiography, <i>Adventures of a Younger Son</i>, as well as his celebrated reminiscences of Shelley and Byron. Trelawny is buried beside Shelley in the English Cemetery in Rome. <br><br><b>Anne Barton</b> is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

In 1979, Pope John Paul II departed from this traditional dichotomy and offered an integrated vision of the human body and soul. In a series of talks that came to be known as &#x201c;the theology of the body,&#x201d; he explained the divine meaning of human sexuality and why the body provides answers to fundamental questions about our lives. <br><br>In <i>Called to Love</i>, Carl Anderson, chairman of the world&#x2019;s largest catholic service organization, and Fr.

As they explain, the body speaks of God, it reveals His goodness, and it also speaks of men and women and their vocation to love. <i>Called to Love </i>brings to life the tremendous gift John Paul II bestowed on humanity and gives readers a new understanding of the Christian way of love and how to embrace it fully in their lives.</p></p><p><p>CARL ANDERSON, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author, is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the Knights of Columbus.

(RT, 8). This wonder, we went on to see, is called forth by the richness of our experience of life-especially by the experience of love. Our task now is to ponder the indispensable role the body plays in this many-faceted experience of wonder.<br>Experience and Meaning<br>We all face the temptation to let life's current carry us along-to "go with the flow" without any resistance. But if we simply let a flood of experiences wash over us, we are in danger of losing the meaning of our lives. A recent survey of teenagers in Southampton, United Kingdom, revealed that this danger is anything but purely theoretical. The respondents, it turned out, possessed only a limited vocabulary to express the emotional quality of their response to the world. These teens suffered from what has been called "affective illiteracy": the inability to grasp and express the meaning of the experiences generated in us by our encounter with the world around us.<br>&nbsp;<br>It isn't enough, then, simply to let our experiences wash over us. We need to plumb their depth. This exploration isn't a matter of "sampling" as many possibilities as we can, or of ratcheting up the volume of our existence, but requires us to ask ourselves questions such as these: Are we capable of distinguishing between experiences that build up our happiness and experiences that tear it down? Are we able to discern in our experiences something like a compass for our life's journey? In a word: Are we capable of perceiving the meaning of our experiences? <br>We tend to put experience and meaning in separate boxes. We have already seen why this won't work. When man experiences the world, he necessarily experiences himself in the process. For the same reason, man's experience of the world always involves an at least minimal search for the meaning of his life. The sight of a majestic mountainscape doesn't just reveal the wonder of creation; it also affords us an opportunity to lay hold of our innate capacity for beauty and wonder. Since the question of man emerges from our contact with the world, experience always goes together with a search for meaning. Even the refusal to embark on this search is an answer to the question of meaning. <br>We had the experience, we missed the meaning <br>And approach to the meaning restores the experience <br>In a different form. <br>These lines from T. S. Eliot's poem "The Dry Salvages" underscore the point that meaning is not foreign to experience. Quite the contrary, meaning is an integral part of experience. So much so, in fact, that meaning makes our experience properly human in the first place. John Paul II's insight into this unity of meaning and experience guided his reflection on the theology of the body, which begins with an effort to recollect the authentic "feel" of man's experience in light of its deepest meaning. In a word, the pope guides us through the labyrinth of our lives using the golden thread of what he calls "original experiences." So what is an "original experience"?<br>The Original Experience<br>John Paul II invites us to seek the true depth of our experience. Actually, it is Christ himself who first entrusted this task to us. When the Pharisees asked him, "Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?" (Matt. 19:3), he didn't list minimum sufficient grounds for divorce, but went instead to the heart of the matter: Is it really possible to love another person forever? The Pharisees clearly assumed that the answer was no. This assumption reflects their (and our) hardness of heart, and it speaks volumes about man's alienation from the root of his experience of love. <br>Christ came to retrieve and fulfill this root of love, and he therefore replies to the Pharisees by telling them to reread the creation accounts in the book of Genesis. He thus invites his questioners to recover the depth of their experience in the mirror of God's original intention for human love. John Paul II takes Christ at his word. As we know, Genesis presents two different accounts of creation, and John Paul II devotes considerable attention to both. Let's start with his reflections on the first narrative (Gen. 1:1-2:3), which lights up the true shape of our experience of everyday life in the blaze of God's Word. <br>The biblical text unfurls the rich tapestry of creation with all of its color and variety. It places man at the summit of the whole created world and underscores his special privilege of being made in the image and likeness of God. The words "image and likeness" signal the overture to the covenant between God and man in the Bible. They tell us that from the beginning man is the one to whom God addresses his Word and whose special status lies in his capacity to answer this divine call. <br>The Bible's affirmation of man's dignity as the "image and likeness of God," which comes at the end of the first creation account, calls for further commentary, because it still leaves open how man is meant to respond to the Creator. Answering this question is the job that falls to the second creation story (Gen. 2:4-3:24), which can thus be seen as the natural continuation of the first. After we've listened to the creative voice of God in the first account, we perceive man's answering voice in the second. The second creation narrative enables us to rediscover the inner experience through which we are to respond to the Creator's call. <br>In other words, the second creation account shifts the point of view of the story: Now it's man who speaks and reveals his interior world. This account doesn't just observe man from the outside; it presents the human journey of wonderment from man's own point of view. By putting us in man's shoes as he was in the beginning, the second creation account unfolds the "original experiences" we spoke of just now. John Paul II sums up these experiences under the three headings of "original solitude," "original unity," and "original nakedness." <br>Before going on to describe these original experiences, though, we should stop to ask ourselves whether we really can describe them, or even have any access to them at all. How can anyone retrieve events that supposedly took place at the very dawn of history? Even if we could do so, we would still face a further difficulty: Aren't the original experiences John Paul II describes permeated by a purity and innocence sin has extinguished in our hearts? How can experiences belonging to a sunken past help us attain happiness here and now? <br>Fortunately, man's original experiences of the beginning have in fact never been totally lost. Two images help illustrate the abiding presence of the beginning in the midst of our everyday reality. <br>The first image comes from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion, which opens with a "creation myth" that compares God's creative design to a piece of music.&nbsp; As Tolkien goes on to relate, Melkor, the dark angel, becomes jealous of God's creative power and tries to introduce a discordant note of his own into the celestial orchestra. Yet, as God reminds Melkor, even this disharmony cannot destroy the pattern of the original music. On the contrary, even Melkor's rebellion will be woven (against his intention) into the final master theme all creation will sing to God's glory. <br>Similarly, we can compare the three original experiences John Paul II refers to with a primordial music that, while distorted through sin, has never completely been destroyed by it. If we listen inattentively, we will hear only noise. If, however, we keep silent and turn our ear to the hidden pattern beneath the noise, we can still discern the original melody that reflects the Creator's wise design. Actually, it's only because the original harmony still resonates in the background that we can hear the dissonance as the disruption it is. <br>Another way of putting this is that the original experiences are not "original" only in the sense that they happened at the beginning of human history. We call the original experiences "original" because they lie at the basis of every other experience and provide the theme for every other music we compose with our lives. Our use of "original," then, has the same double meaning as the Greek word arch&#x17d;, which signifies both a temporal beginning and the foundations of a building. This leads us to the second image that illustrates the continuing accessibility of man's original experiences. <br>As the facade of Saint Peter's Basilica was being cleaned recently in preparation for the Jubilee of the year 2000, the workers were surprised by the green color of the marble surrounding the central windows. Some even thought that the chemical agents used to clean the building were destroying the marble's original color. Consultation of the original plans for the basilica, however, brought to light that this green was indeed the true color of the stone. It's just that it had been covered in grime for so long that no one could recollect its original appearance. <br>A similar grime builds up over our attitude toward life. As children, we live close to the original experiences of Adam and Eve, but as we grow up their freshness is progressively polluted by layers of routine and mechanization. The French philosopher Gabriel Marcel once said that we are the bureaucrats of our own existence, who have buried our original contact with life under mountains of paperwork and procedures that impair our capacity to discern the human drama lying beneath them.&nbsp; <br>If Marcel is right, then the child is closer to man's original experiences, but the adult has almost forgotten them (but not quite). Since the original experiences hover as a vague memory on the borders of our adult awareness, the effort to recov...</p><h2>Stories from the Silk Road</h2><p>Describes the ancient techniques of silkmaking and the history of the Silk Road from China to Samarkand, and provides a selection of traditional tales from each stage of the journey</p><p>Cherry Gilchrist has written several books for children, including Sun-day Moon-day - How the Week was Made (1998) and A Calendar of Festivals (1999).

Cherry runs a business which specialises in Russian arts and she visits Russia regularly. She lives in Bath, England. Nilesh Mistry was born in Bombay and moved to London in 1975. He studied Illustration at Harrow School of Art And Central St. Martin&#39;s School of Art. Nilesh has illustrated the popular The Story of Divaali for Barefoot Books and lives in LondonGrade 2-4-Gilchrist has clearly done substantial research for this collection of folktales from countries along the ancient trade route. She has uncovered so much information to supplement the folklore that she includes an introduction; a character called the "Spirit of the Silk Road," whose two-page spiels preface each individual story; and two pages of facts at the end of the book. The result is a collection of seven tales, somewhat weighted down by the burden of explanatory matter. The stories themselves are unusual enough that libraries with large folklore collections or with a strong interest in Asia may want to purchase this title. A few of the selections are reminiscent of European or American variants. "Clever Ashik" is similar to the riddle-solving "Clever Gretchen" and the wish-granting "Magic Saddlebag" is like Jack's magic tablecloth in "Jack and the Northwest Wind." Other tales are more culture specific, such as "Monkey and the River Dragon" from China or "A Rainbow in Silk" from Uzbekistan. Gilchrist's writing is bland, showing little variation as she moves from people to people. Mistry's gouache paintings illuminate the costumes, architecture, and terrain along the way.

Friend of the Left, son of the Right, he paints in a superbly tailored, three-piece suit and houses friends who include a poet, a painter, and a feminist sculptress whom he has painted nude and hung it in the drawing room. Is he perhaps in love with Edna? If so, she isn't having any.</p><p>Sinclair's fortune and his indifference to politics shelter him from the mounting tensions of the Great Depression roiling Australia and taking it near the brink of revolution.</p><p>One day in December 1931 comes terrible news: Uncle Rowly has been murdered in his home by unknown assailants. The murder prompts Roland to infiltrate the echelons of the old and new guard. Among them are a few "right thinking men," a cadre of conservatives who became convinced of a Communist takeover and have formed a movement to combat it. In time, Rowland's investigation exposes an extraordinary conspiracy with direct personal consequences.</p></p><p><p>After setting out to study astrophysics, graduating in law and then abandoning her legal career to write books, Sulari now grows French black truffles on her farm in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains of NSW. Sulari is author of The Rowland Sinclair Mystery series, historical crime fiction novels (eight in total) set in the 1930s. Sulari's&nbsp;<em>A Decline in Prophets</em>&nbsp;(the second book in the series) was the winner of the Davitt Award for Best Adult Crime Fiction 2012. She was also shortlisted for Best First Book (<em>A Few Right Thinking Men</em>) for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize 2011.&nbsp;<em>Paving the New Road</em>&nbsp;was shortlisted for another Davitt in 2013.</p>"Fans of Kerry Greenwood's Phryne Fisher series, rejoice: here comes another Depression-era Australian sleuth! Along the way there is plenty of solid discussion of politics and social status, with enough context to both draw in those new to the era and keep those more well-versed in their history interested.<br>" - <strong><em> Historical Novel Society </em></strong><br><br>"As series-launching novels go, this one is especially successful: the plot effectively plays Sinclair's aristocratic bearing and involvement in the arts against the Depression setting, fraught with radical politics, both of which he becomes involves in as he turns sleuth. And Sinclair himself is a delight: wining us over completely and making us feel as though he's an old friend.<br>" - <strong><em> Booklist STARRED Review </em></strong><br><br>"While the vintage Down Under settings might make this debut, which was short-listed for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best First Book, comparable to Kerry Greenwood's Melbourne-based Phryne Fisher 1920s mysteries, Gentill works in historical events that add verisimilitude to her story. There are more political machinations going on here than Phryne could ever contemplate. VERDICT: Thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for bringing another award-winning Australian crime writer to U.S. shores. Her witty hero will delight traditional mystery buffs.<br>" - <strong><em> Library Journal STARRED Review </em></strong><br><br>"It takes a talented writer to imbue history with colour and vivacity... A <i>Few Right Thinking Men</i> more than matches its historical crime contemporaries... It is rare to find such an assured debut as A <i>Few Right Thinking Men</i>.

Because of the intense interest in extraordinary religious experience that ranges from Medjugorje to the New Age, Groeschel's book is an urgently needed resource that gives practical norms to everyone on how to evaluate these claims. Drawing on spiritual classics and Church documents not readily available, he summarizes the Church's perennial wisdom on this topic. <p>He also offers an alternative to unusual and extraordinary ways of knowing the things of God, which is a normal everyday opportunity open to all called "religious experience"--the action of grace operating in the context of a human life that can become a powerful source of virtue and holiness. Father Groeschel skillfully directs the reader to the humbler and safer path which discerns God's presence in prayer, Scripture, the sacraments and love of neighbor. The great example of this path to holiness is St. Therese of Lisieux who, though having very few extraordinary experiences, was filled with a profound awareness of God's presence and said, "To ecstasy, I prefer the monotony of sacrifice."</p></p><p><p><strong>Fr. Benedict Groeschel, CFR</strong>is the director of the Office of Spiritual Development for the New York Archdiocese. He has written numerous books on the spiritual life and pastoral counseling. He is a member of the Franciscans of the Renewal who preach evangelical reform and work with the homeless in the South Bronx.</p><p>"A brilliant investigation into a complex and fascinating subject in which the boundaries of mysticism, psychology and spiritual direction intersect.

Professor of Religious Studies St. Edward's University, Austin, Texas</p><p><br><br></p><p>"Combining insights from mystical theology and modern psychology, Father Groeschel offers much sound advice for sorting through competing claims of divine revelations.

Besides the inscrutable figure of artist Marcel Duchamp, the European contingent included such iconoclastic visitors as the playboy painter Francis Picabia, the composer Edgard Varese, the diplomat Henri-Pierre Roche (author of Jules et Jim and adviser to the extraordinary collector John Quinn), and painters Albert Gleizes and Jean Crotti. Among the Americans were the photographer/painter/constructor Man Ray, the Precisionist painter and Fortune photographer Charles Sheeler, the Futurist Joseph Stella, and the Pennsylvania artists Charles Demuth and Morton Schamberg. New York Dada is the first comprehensive study devoted exclusively to the accomplishments of these vanguard artists in America in the period 1915-23 - among the most underappraised, though most influential periods in the history of American art. Within months after the word &#34;Dada&#34; was discovered by a group of refugee artists and writers living in Switzerland, news of the movement reached artists in New York, who, by then, had already made works of art and engaged in activities that were similar in spirit to those produced by their European counterparts. For this groundbreaking book, Francis M. Naumann has interviewed virtually all the survivors and has amassed a wealth of rare photographs and newspaper clippings, including pictures of early installations of modern art in homes and exhibitions, to capture the spirit of New York Dada in a work that is both informative and captivating. In view of the current trendto investigate the potential of a conceptually oriented approach to art and to the art-making process, it is perhaps no coincidence that New York Dada is now finally recognized for the important role it played in the formative phases of a modernist aesthetic.</p><p>Francis M. Naumann has taught at Parsons School of Design and the City University of New York.</p><h2>Getting Focused Staying Focused</h2><p>Pages clean and unmarked.

Timeless yet tirelessly inventive, Bang fashions her examination of the lived life into an abecedarius that is as rapturous in its language and music as it is affecting in its awareness of--and yearning for--what isn't there. The title of the first poem, "ABC Plus E: Cosmic Aloneness Is the Bride of Existence," posits the collection's central problem, and a symposium of figures from every register of our culture (from Plato to Pee-wee Herman, Mickey Mouse to Sartre) is assembled to help confront it. Riddled with insight, pathos, and wit, <i>The Bride of E</i> is a brilliant new work by one the most compelling poets of our time.</p></p><p><p><b>Mary Jo Bang</b> is the author of five previous books of poetry, including <i>Louise in Love</i>, <i>The Eye Like a Strange Balloon</i>, and <i>Elegy</i>, which won the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award in Poetry and was named a 2008 <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri, where she is a Professor of English and teaches in the Creative Writing Program at Washington University.</p>Starred Review. In her follow-up to the National Book Critics Circle Award&#x2013;winning <i>Elegy</i>, Bang is up to some of her old tricks again, but the previous collection's tour of a loss-inflected world has also taught her some new ones. The book takes the alphabet as its jumping-off point, with one or more poems titled for each letter (A Equals All of a Sudden, Beast Brutality, etc.) Here again are Bang's quirky poetic leaps (In another corner, Freud says, Yes/ In the dark of primitive desire means yes/ Forever), but somehow they are more foreboding than before, the wild associations of a haunted mind: The note rises from something awful./ A woman in a jam. Train wreck of crumpled cars. Poems vamp on literature, fables, fairy tales, pop culture icons (like Cher) and shards of a lost childhood world. One poem rewrites Poe's most famous work (Her name is Lenore Nevermore), while B is for Beckett sums up the Nobel laureate's work in one line: There is so little to say. The book concludes with a short series of prose pieces that flirt with memoir. This book bridges a gap between an experimental tradition in American poetry and an older high lyric tradition. This is some of Bang's best writing, and one of the most exciting books of the year. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But very soon Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge; she has carried her troubles with her. Months later, Mattie&#39;s husband Carl returns from the war to find his wife mysteriously drowned and his daughter being raised by prickly and possessive Amanda. What happened the night Mattie died? For years the consequences of that event reverberate, and the truth, when it is finally revealed, is both dramatic and extraordinarily moving.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, September 2000:</b> For 19th-century novelists--from Jane Austen to George Eliot, Flaubert to Henry James--social constraint gave a delicious tension to their plots. Yet now our relaxed morals and social mobility have rendered many of the classics untenable. Why shouldn't Maisie know what she knows? It will all come out in family therapy anyway. The vogue for historical novels depends in part on our pleasure in reentering a world of subtle cues and repressed emotion, a time in which a young woman could destroy her life by saying yes to the wrong man. After all, there was no reliable birth control, no divorce, no chance of an independent life or a scandal-free separation. <p>Christina Schwarz's suspenseful debut pivots on two of the lost "virtues" of the past: silence and stoicism. <i>Drowning Ruth</i> opens in 1919, on the heels of the influenza epidemic that followed the First World War. Although there were telephones and motor cars and dance halls in the small towns of Wisconsin in those years, the townspeople remained rigid and forbidding. As a young woman, Amanda Starkey, a Lutheran farmer's daughter, had been firmly discouraged from an inappropriate marriage with a neighboring Catholic boy. A few years later, as a nurse in Milwaukee, she is seduced by a dishonorable man. Her shame sends her into a nervous breakdown, and she returns to the family farm. Within a year, though, her beloved sister Mathilde drowns under mysterious circumstances. And when Mathilde's husband, Carl, returns from the war, he finds his small daughter, Ruth, in Amanda's tenacious grip, and she will tell him nothing about the night his wife drowned. Amanda's parents, too, are long gone. "I killed my parents. Had I mentioned that?" muses Amanda. </p><blockquote> I killed them because I felt a little fatigued and suffered from a slight, persistent cough. Thinking I was overworked and hadn't been getting enough sleep, I went home for a short visit, just a few days to relax in the country while the sweet corn and the raspberries were ripe. From the city I brought fancy ribbon, two boxes of Ambrosia chocolate, and a deadly gift... I gave the influenza to my mother, who gave it to my father, or maybe it was the other way around. </blockquote> Schwarz is a skillful writer, weaving her grim tale across several decades, always returning to the fateful night of Mathilde's death. <i>Drowning Ruth</i> displays her gift for pacing and her harsh insistence on the right ending, rather than the cheery one. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Deftly written and emotionally powerful, Drowning Ruth is a stunning portrait of the ties that bind sisters together and the forces that tear them apart, of the dangers of keeping secrets and the explosive repercussions when they are exposed. A mesmerizing and achingly beautiful debut.<br>Winter, 1919. Amanda Starkey spends her days nursing soldiers wounded in the Great War. Finding herself suddenly overwhelmed, she flees Milwaukee and retreats to her family's farm on Nagawaukee Lake, seeking comfort with her younger sister, Mathilda, and three-year-old niece, Ruth. But very soon, Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge--she has carried her troubles with her. On one terrible night almost a year later, Amanda loses nearly everything that is dearest to her when her sister mysteriously disappears and is later found drowned beneath the ice that covers the lake. When Mathilda's husband comes home from the war, wounded and troubled himself, he finds that Amanda has taken charge of Ruth and the farm, assuming her responsibility with a frightening intensity. Wry and guarded, Amanda tells the story of her family in careful doses, as anxious to hide from herself as from us the secrets of her own past and of that night.<br>Ruth, haunted by her own memory of that fateful night, grows up under the watchful eye of her prickly and possessive aunt and gradually becomes aware of the odd events of her childhood. As she tells her own story with increasing clarity, she reveals the mounting toll that her aunt's secrets exact from her family and everyone around her, until the heartrending truth is uncovered.<br>Guiding us through the lives of the Starkey women, Christina Schwarz's first novel shows her compassion and a unique understanding of the American landscape and the people who live on it.</p><h2>1939: The Last Season</h2><p><p><strong>A wonderful portrait of British upper-class life in the Season of 1939 - the last before the Second World War.</strong></p><p>The Season of 1939 brought all those 'in Society' to London.

What he sees on his journey, and his eventual encounter with Kurtz, horrify and perplex him, and call into question the very bases of civilization and human nature. Endlessly reinterpreted by critics and adapted for film, radio, and television, the story shows Conrad at his most intense and sophisticated. The other three tales in this volume depict corruption and obsession, and question racial assumptions. Set in the exotic surroundings of Africa, Malaysia, and the east, they variously appraise the glamour, folly, and rapacity of imperial adventure. This revised edition uses the British first edition texts and has a new chronology and bibliography.</p><p></p><h2>Minimal Art</h2><p>Founded as a backlash against abstract expressionism, minimalism was characterized by simplified, stripped-down forms and materials used to express ideas in a direct and impersonal manner. By presenting objects as simple objects, minimal artists sought to communicate without referring to expressive or historical themes. This critical movement, which began in the 1960s and branched out into land art, performance art, and conceptual art, is still a major influence today.

Ever tried tilting a board to make colour run when painting rain? A simple idea but it can very effective. As Terry points out, always let the painting dry on a slight slope so as to prevent the paint running back. His suggestion for painting the sun is equally ingenious - use a coin!

This highly anticipated second edition includes a new preface by Joseph Ratzinger/Pope Benedict XVI and a supplement to the bibliography by theologian Peter A. Casarella. <p> <i>Eschatology</i> presents a balanced perspective of the doctrine at the center of Christian belief--the Church's faith in eternal life. Recognizing the task of contemporary eschatology as "to marry perspectives, so that person and community, present and future, are seen in their unity," Joseph Ratzinger brings together recent emphasis on the theology of hope for the future with the more traditional elements of the doctrine. His book has proven to be as timeless as it is timely.</p></p><p>Pope Benedict XVI is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual writers of our age.

Crewed mostly by Filipinos who did not speak English and armed with a cannon that had last seen service in the Spanish-American War, the <i>Lanikai</i> was under top-secret presidential orders to sail south into waters where the Japanese fleet was thought to be. Ostensibly the crew was to spy on Japanese naval movements, but to Tolley it was clear that their mission was to create an incident that would provoke war. Events overtook the plan, however, when Pearl Harbor was bombed before the <i>Lanikai</i>could get underway. When Bataan and Corregidor fell, she was ordered to set sail for Australia and became one of the few U.S. naval vessels to escape the Philippines. In this book Tolley tells the saga of her great adventure during these grim, early days of the war and makes history come alive as he regales the reader with details of the operation and an explanation of President Roosevelt's order. Tolley's description of their escape in Japanese warship-infested waters ranks with the best of sea tales, and few will be able to forget the <i>Lanikai</i>'s 4,000-mile, three-month odyssey.</p><p>The late Kemp Tolley, also the author of <i>Cruise of the Lanikai</i> and <i>Yangtze Patrol</i> enjoyed a long naval career before retiring from the U.S. Navy at the rank of Rear Admiral."Cruise of the Lanikai is one of the great sea adventures of the twentieth century." -- <i>Baltimore Sun</i><br><br>"Long considered one of the great sea sagas of World War II..." -- <i>Sea Classics</i><br><br>"Makes history come alive." -- <i>The Retired Officer</i></p><h2>Ancient Greece</h2><p>Focuses on the personalities and historical events which shaped the civilization of ancient Greece, from the story of the Trojan War to the conquests of Alexander the Great.</p><p>As a picture-book introduction to ancient Greece, this book succeeds in acquainting young readers with some of the major events, places, and people of that civilization. Legends of the labyrinth of Knossos, Troy, and Atlantis are explained by the discoveries of Schliemann, Evans, and more recent scientific finds. Also, the book points out how some aspects of early culture came about, such as rituals involving the worship of Dionysus evolving into later Greek theater. Text and illustrations are well matched, creating an attractive, colorful blend. However, for an elementary introduction to a major civilization not to include even a rudimentary map is a serious flaw. Unless readers are well versed in geography, they cannot comprehend Greece's relationship to the rest of the ancient world or the significance of Alexander's military accomplishments. Sometimes too little information is more confusing than too much. Judith Crosher's The Greeks (Silver Burdett, 1977) is better organized and more comprehensive.<br><i>- Cynthia M.

McDougall is professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania.Generation-spanning tales of the North Pacific from a Pulitzer-winning historian who's also a gifted storyteller. Given the breadth of the claim he's staked on a vast area that extends along a coastal arc from Baja California to China, it's no wonder that McDougall (...The Heavens and the Earth, 1985) chose a Michener-like format for his absorbing if episodic saga. It's the author's elegantly effective conceit that the favorite consort of Hawaii's King Kamehameha has summoned him and others to pass judgment on regional events over a span of nearly four centuries. Among the heavenly guests are Hiresi Saito (Japan's ambassador to the US during the 1930's), Junipero Serra (the Spanish monk whose missions opened Alta California to white settlement), William Henry Seward (Lincoln's secretary of state), and Count Sergey Witte (Tsar Nicholas II's prime minister). With more than a dozen breaks for spirited colloquies with his phantom collaborators, McDougall offers short-take accounts of historical milestones ranging in time from the opening of new sea lanes during the late 16th century through the 1950 outbreak of hostilities between North and South Korea. Covered along the way are oceangoing voyages of discovery (by Captain Cook et al.); development of the fur trade; gold rushes; earthquakes (in Tokyo as well as San Francisco); the impact of transport technologies (steamships, railroads, aircraft); the US purchase of Alaska; imperial Japan's conflicts with Russia; WW II; and more. While offbeat, the author's framework allows him to focus on questions he deems most consequential and to examine them from several standpoints. The discontinuous chronicle addresses substantive issues throughout, concluding, among other matters, that over the years demographic forces have proved far stronger than governmental imperatives. Perceptive, coherent perspectives--mounted in a flashy and accessible text--on a once-remote domain that's a world unto itself.

He was only twenty-five when his first novel, <b>Buddenbrooks</b>, was published. In 1924 <b>The Magic Mountain</b> was published, and, five years later, Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he left Germany for good in 1933 to live in Switzerland and then in California, where he wrote <b>Doctor Faustus</b> (first published in the United States in 1948).

As gripping as a great mystery novel -- but true -- and as important as any book on computer security -- but eminently readable by anyone. <p> You can read more about Mitnick specifically or computer crime and social engineering generally in Jonathan Littman's recent The Fugitive Game: Online With Kevin Mitnick, or in any one of a sampler of books on computer crimes and computer cracking.</p>Computer security expert Shimomura gained instant celebrity with his highly publicized capture of Kevin Mitnick, a notorious computer hacker who allegedly plundered the Internet at will, stealing files and information from computer systems throughout the world. Markoff, a new breed of cyberspace journalist, was the sole reporter present when Mitnick was arrested, invited by Shimomura to cover the bust. Markoff's account of this story first appeared on the front page of the New York Times on February 16, 1995, the day after the bust. Markoff and Shimomura were friends, and Markoff's previous book, Cyberpunk (LJ 6/1/91), devoted a third of its content to the nefarious Mitnick. Takedown is a riveting account of the investigation and capture of a skilled hacker by a brilliant cybersleuth. Littman, an investigative reporter, has also written a compelling narrative of the Mitnick case. In contrast to Takedown, Littman captures Mitnick's side of the story. He focuses on Mitnick's motives and ambitions, drawing on personal conversations and correspondence with the world-class hacker while he was still a fugitive. Littman alleges questionable motives on the part of Shimomura and Markoff as they tread the murky water of journalistic ethics surrounding book advances, movie deals, talk-show appearances, and speaking fees. He exposes a conflict of interest raised by the financial rewards Shimomura and Markoff received by cooperating with the FBI, and asserts that the ensuing publicity over Internet security and the need for tougher laws distracted us from the real issue of a constitutional right to privacy on the information superhighway. Most libraries should have both The Fugitive Game and Takedown.<br><i>-?Joe Accardi, Northeastern Illlinois Univ.

Over five decades his career spanned the flowering of the modern theatre in the USA, and he designed many of its most famous productions, including &#34;A Streetcar Named Desire&#34;, &#34;Death of a Salesman&#34;, &#34;Guys and Dolls&#34; and &#34;Carousel&#34;. He worked with a roster of great playwrights, directors and producers on a staggering total of 260 shows, many of them theatrical premieres, but also including ballets, operas and motion pictures. He pioneered many concepts of design - such as the capturing of a visual metaphor for the production -that are taken for granted today. His influence for succeeding generations has been enormous.

Part of a generation that took the radical design and lighting ideas of Gordon Craig and Adolph Appia and made them their own, Mielziner designed sets for the premier productions of many of the plays we now consider modern American classics, including <i>A </i> Glass Menagerie, <i>A Streetcar Named</i> <i>Desire</i> , and <i>Death of a Salesman.</i> An amazingly prolific designer, Mielziner also made his mark on American musical theater, designing shows as different as <i>South Pacific</i> , <i>Guys and Dolls</i> , and <i>Gypsy.</i> This glossy, lavishly illustrated, oversize book presents hundreds of Mielziner's designs and drawings, many in color, documenting the full arc of his career, from '20s work with the Theatre Guild to his final projects, assisting the design of new theaters throughout America.

Reprint.</p><p>Paul Tingen is a Scotland-based music journalist who has written for publications in the US, UK, Japan, and Australia for over 14 years.Easily one of the most influential musicians in the history of jazz, Miles Davis is the archetypal jazz artist: a brilliant, elusive and enigmatic virtuoso. Since he arrived in New York in the late 1940s to work with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, Davis has transformed the jazz idiom, initiating a series of new jazz movements beginning with the cool jazz period in the early 1950s and continuing with the release of the groundbreaking album Kind of Blue at the end of the decade. But the accolades from jazz critics and fans usually end with his late 1960s work; around that time, Miles abandoned conventional jazz practices to experiment with avant-garde improvisation, rock music and electric instruments, using elaborate, electronic postproduction techniques to hone his studio recordings. Those explorations became what is now known as "fusion." Music journalist Tingen meticulously dissects Miles's bands, sidemen and musical techniques, offering a wealth of candid firsthand commentary on Miles and his music from former sidemen like pianist Herbie Hancock, guitarist John McLaughlin, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and other musicians, as well as Miles's friends, lovers and ex-wives. Most importantly, Tingen examines Miles's always turbulent but wildly creative relationship with Teo Macero, his producer at Columbia Records. Tingen can sometimes be at once presumptuous and contradictory, summarily declaring, for instance, that a recording should have been radically trimmed even after repeatedly praising Miles's knack for minimalist masterpieces. Nevertheless, Tingen has written a lucid, detailed and illuminating study of a generally misunderstood, often critically dismissed period in the creative life of one of this country's greatest musical innovators. The book also contains an extensive musician list, discography, bibliography and sessionology. 10 b&amp;w photos, not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Vampyre and Ernestus Berchtold or The Modern Eedipus</h2><p><p> In 1816, John William Polidori travelled to Geneva as Lord Byron&#x2019;s personal physician. There they met Mary Godwin (later Shelley) and her lover Percy Shelley and decided to while away a wet summer by writing ghost stories. The only two to complete their stories were Mary Shelley, who published <em>Frankenstein</em> in 1818, and Polidori, whose <em>The Vampyre</em> and <em>Ernestus Berchtold</em> were both published in 1819. </p> <p> <em>The Vampyre</em>, based on a discarded idea of Byron&#x2019;s, is the first portrayal of the alluring vampire figure familiar to readers of Bram Stoker and Anne Rice. Ernestus Berchtold scandalously draws on the rumours of Byron&#x2019;s affair with his half-sister for a Faustian updating of the myth of Oedipus, which it combines with an account of the struggle of Swiss patriots against the Napoleonic invasion. </p> <p> Along with Polidori&#x2019;s work, this edition also includes stories read and written by the travellers in the Genevan summer of 1816 and contemporary responses to <em>The Vampyre</em> and <em>Ernestus Berchtold</em>. </p></p><p><p> The late <strong>D.L.

Her literary work has appeared in <i>Penguin Modern Poets Volume 8</i> and <i>The Oxford Book of Caribbean Short Stories</i>.</p>This first novel by a Caribbean poet relates a familiar story: thanks to her mother's determination and sacrifices, the daughter of an impoverished provincial family receives a college education and returns to her family alienated by her inevitable politicization, her own growth mirroring the struggles of her country (in this case, Grenada) to gain political autonomy. What distinguishes this work is its lyrical rendering. Collins's characters think and speak in patois: " 'People like you an me so, the harder we work in people kitchen and in people lan, the more we kill weself out and bring riches, is the poorer we get while we sweat goin in other people pocket.' " The initial strain imposed by the singular language quickly abates, and the technique enables the reader to share the perspectives of the protagonists and implicitly challenges the hegemony of "standard" English. In spite of the feminist and political themes, the characters are never reduced to mere mouthpieces; their dignity lies in their remaining conflicted even as they struggle with oppression. When America invades Grenada, the title character says, " 'We wrong. But that don make dem right.' " The combination of artistry and objectivity will commend this book to many readers. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Plain English for lawyers</h2><p>Now in its fourth edition, Wydick's book stands the test of time.

Paul Wilson builds the concluding chapter of Repairman Jack: The Early Years, the prequel trilogy focusing on the formative years of Wilson's globally popular supernatural troubleshooter.</p><p>The strands of Jack's life, established in the first two books,<i> Cold City</i> and <i>Dark City</i>, are now woven into a complete pattern. </p><p>Centered around an obscure group of malcontents intent on creating a terrible explosion in New York City in 1993, <i>Fear City</i> shows the final stages of young Jack becoming Repairman Jack.

Jack threads his way through this intricate maze, as people he loves are stripped away from him in a way that presages the later epic series of novels.</p></p><p><p>F. PAUL WILSON, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Repairman Jack novels, lives in Wall, New Jersey. In 2008, he won the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Is this the Shadow?&#x201d; Jack said, holding up the cellophane envelope. &#x201c;I mean, <i>the</i> Shadow?&#x201d;</p> <p>The sixtyish guy behind the counter&#x2014;lank hair, three-day stubble, ratty brown cardigan&#x2014;looked annoyed as he brought it close to his smeared glasses and squinted at the label. Jack wondered how he saw anything through them.</p> <p>&#x201c;If it says &#x2018;genuine glow in the dark Shadow ring,&#x2019; which it does, then that&#x2019;s what it is.&#x201d;</p> <p>Attracted by the BACK-DATE MAGAZINES sign, Jack had wandered into this narrow, coffin-sized store off Times Square. The place seemed to specialize in <i>Life</i> magazine and had moldy issues piled to the ceiling. Jack had been curious to see if the place stocked any old pulps. It did, but only a few, and those had disconcerting titles like <i>Ranch Romances</i> and <i>Fifteen Love Stories</i>. None of the <i>Black Mask</i> types he was hunting for. But tucked in among the yellowed, flaking issues he&#x2019;d found the ring.</p> <p>The white plastic body was shaped like the Shadow on each side&#x2014;Jack could even make out a .45 Colt semiauto in one hand&#x2014;but the stone set in the top was bright blue and shaped like Gibraltar.</p> <p>&#x201c;But this looks nothing like the Shadow&#x2019;s girasol ring.&#x201d;</p> <p>The guy stared at him. &#x201c;Do you even know what a girasol is?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fire opal.&#x201d;</p> <p>This seemed to take him by surprise. &#x201c;Okay. Point for you. What are you&#x2014;eighteen?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack didn&#x2019;t react. He got this all the time. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re half a dozen short.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Coulda fooled me. But still a kid. How does a twenty-four-year-old like you know about the Shadow&#x2019;s girasol ring?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Read a few old issues.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the pulp Shadow. The character started on radio, sponsored by a company called Blue Coal. That blue plastic &#x2018;stone&#x2019; there is supposed to be a chunk of blue coal.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack was thinking it was just about the neatest thing he&#x2019;d seen in a long time.</p> <p>&#x201c;And it glows in the dark too?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it says. Never tested it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Twenty bucks.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be a bargain next year after the movie comes out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What movie?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>The Shadow</i>. Gonna star Alec Baldwin, I hear.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack remembered him from <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>. Yeah, he had the look for the Lamont Cranston part.</p> <p>&#x201c;So if I&#x2019;m tired of it next year you&#x2019;ll buy it back for more?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t promise that. Can&#x2019;t even promise I&#x2019;ll be here, what with Disney moving in.&#x201d;</p> <p>News to Jack.</p> <p>&#x201c;Disney? Here?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Word is they&#x2019;re negotiating a ninety-nine-year lease on the Amsterdam.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Donald Duck on the Deuce? No way.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s scared shitless because it&#x2019;ll be proof that the Times Square cleanup every mayor since LaGuardia&#x2019;s been talking about is gonna happen, and you know what that means.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack pushed aside a vision of Minnie Mouse in hot pants saying, &#x201c;Hiya, sailor.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Rents through the roof. Guys like me forced out, moving over to Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen or farther downtown or just closing up and walking away.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, no! Where will people go for their copies of <i>Ranch Romances</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>His eyes narrowed behind the grimy lenses. &#x201c;You a wiseass?&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack could see the guy was genuinely worried. He thought about boxing up and moving all those copies of <i>Life</i> and regretted the remark.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sometimes the mouth runs ahead of the brain.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;People get in trouble that way.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell me about it.&#x201d;</p> <p>He forked over a Jackson. The guy slipped it into his pocket and didn&#x2019;t ask for sales tax. Fine.</p> <p>Jack walked out with his treasure and slipped it onto his pinky finger. He ambled east toward Times Square, thinking not of the Shadow but of Disney instead.</p> <p>What he remembered most about Disney World from the couple of times his folks had taken him there during the seventies was how clean it had been. Could that happen here? Times Square was anything but clean, and 42nd Street even less so. But grime and kitsch and porn and fringe people were part of the ambience. Take that away and replace it with a bunch of high-end chain stores and what did you have? You had a freaking mall. Might as well move back to Jersey.</p> <p>As he crossed Duffy Square and headed up Seventh Avenue, he realized the writing had been on the wall for a couple of years now, ever since the state started buying up properties along the Deuce, especially the old theaters.</p> <p><i>Plus �a change&#x2026;?</i></p> <p>Jack doubted it.</p> <p>If the magazine guy was right about the Amsterdam, then change was sure as hell coming and, as far as Jack was concerned, not for the better. Well, better if you were a landlord, but no way for a small businessman. Things would not, as the saying went, stay the same. All the quirky little stores and all the quirky people who frequented them and all the quirky people who ran them were going to go the way of the Neanderthals.</p> <p>His growing dark mood about the end of an era was blown away by the sight of a familiar face trying to hail a cab across the street from the Winter Garden. She was talking on a mobile phone as she waved her arm.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cristin?&#x201d;</p> <p>She turned and, for an instant, looked not-so-pleasantly surprised. Then she smiled. &#x201c;Jack! How nice to see you!&#x201d;</p> <p>They shared a quick, slightly awkward hug.</p> <p>He pointed to her phone&#x2014;one of the new smaller versions. Unlike the older brick-size models with the big antenna, these could fit in a pocket. He noticed NOKIA under the oblong screen.</p> <p>&#x201c;Up with the latest technology, I see.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I looove this thing! It&#x2019;s made my life so easy. No more looking for a pay phone.&#x201d;</p> <p>He gave her a lopsided grin and cocked his head toward the Winter Garden marquee. &#x201c;Going to see <i>Cats</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not likely.&#x201d;</p> <p>Their fling thing had lasted two years and during that whole period the only time they&#x2019;d been to a theater was to see Penn &amp; Teller. Cristin had ended it. She hadn&#x2019;t called it quits, per se, more like weaned them off each other. They used to get together every Sunday&#x2014;every single Sunday&#x2014;but last fall she&#x2019;d started begging off with increasingly lame excuses until Jack got the message.</p> <p>She may have engineered the actual parting, but Jack had been the reason. They&#x2019;d gone into the relationship with the understanding that they&#x2019;d get together one day a week and be friends with benefits, nothing more. Cristin had been very strict about not wanting strings and Jack had been all for it. At least at first. Along the way he became attached and started wanting more. But Cristin wasn&#x2019;t looking for more. She liked things just the way they were and wouldn&#x2019;t bend.</p> <p>Jack had suffered through the process of attenuation, but after clearing the air at an official breakup lunch between Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s, they&#x2019;d parted friends.</p> <p>Seeing Cristin again for the first time in weeks made him realize he was still carrying a torch for her.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve let your hair grow,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;A little.&#x201d;</p> <p>She had a roundish face, dark hair, blue eyes, and a bright smile that always made him want to smile too. She wore her fur-lined raincoat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can I see?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The <i>ama-gi</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You still getting off on that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about getting off&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, did a quick turn, and lifted her hair. She had one tattoo and it decorated her nape: a Sumerian symbol known as <i>ama-gi</i>.</p> <p>He caught the briefest glimpse, and then she dropped her hair.</p> <p>&#x201c;I was heading for a late lunch&#x2026;&#x201d; he began.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;d love to, Jack, but I&#x2019;ve got to get down to FIT. I have a class.&#x201d;</p> <p>Years ago she&#x2019;d dropped out of the Fashion Institute to work full time for an event planning operation called Celebrations. The job kept her hopping all over the city, but she still wanted her degree and took one course a semester to keep herself moving toward it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Tomorrow then? Or Thursday?&#x201d;</p> <p>He hoped he didn&#x2019;t sound desperate. He didn&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> desperate&nbsp;&#x2026; he simply wanted to spend a little time with her.</p> <p>She gave him a long look. &#x201c;Just lunch?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two old friends from high school sharing food and small talk.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled. &#x201c;That sounds great. Dutch, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p> <p>She&#x2019;d always insisted on paying her share and, since Jack wasn&#x2019;t exactly flush these days, that was a good thing. Cristin, on the other hand, made excellent money planning events.</p> <p>But where to eat?</p> <p>Apparently she already had an idea. &#x201c;I found a cool little French place on East Sixty-first called Le Pistou.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jack made a face. &#x201c;Really? What&#x2019;s choice number two?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But you like French.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; He could eat just about anything, even snails. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know if I could eat at a place called Piss Stew.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s vegetable soup.&#x201d;</p> <p>He held up his hands. &#x201c;Stop. You&#x2019;re only making it worse.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never change,&#x201d; she said through a laugh. &#x201c;Thursday&#x2019;s good. Meet there noonish?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Deal.&#x201d;</p> <p>He hailed her a cab and one pulled over right away.</p> <p>&#x201c;But just for lunch,&#x201d; she said as he held the door for her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course. We broke up, remember?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I do. But you don&#x2019;t know why.&#x201d;</p> <p>That took him by surprise. &#x201c;I thought it was because I was getting too attached.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. I was.&#x201d;</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek then slipped into the cab. He shook his head as he watched it weave down Seventh.</p> <p>Cristin, Cristin, Cristin&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>Despite her paranoia about strings, she seemed happy with where she was in her life. He didn&#x2019;t know anybody else like that. That didn&#x2019;t mean she was going to stay put. He knew she was three years into a five-year plan that involved socking away every extra cent for now and eventually opening her own boutique to sell her original designs.</p> <p>She was also happy with <i>who</i> she was. Jack wondered what that felt like.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d read something from Wilde last year and his brain had attached it to Cristin: <i>Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else&#x2019;s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.</i> Not because Wilde had been describing Cristin, but because it was so <i>not</i> Cristin. He didn&#x2019;t know anyone who thought like Cristin. She danced to her own tune and to hell with what everyone else was playing.</p> <p>He missed her.</p> <p>When her cab disappeared into the traffic crush he turned and continued his uptown ramble.</p> <p>Okay, the week was looking better, even if it involved a French restaurant in the East Sixties. How bad could lunch be? Twenty bucks apiece? Thirty?</p> <p>Yeah, his resources had dwindled. Perhaps he&#x2019;d been too generous in his flush days. He didn&#x2019;t regret it, though. He lived a simple life. His two major expenses were rents: on his apartment and on the garage space for Ralph. Other than that, he lived on junk food and beer.</p> <p>His fix-it business hadn&#x2019;t exactly taken off. He collected a fee now and again, but the jobs were sporadic. Nothing he could count on. So he&#x2019;d been supplementing his income as a waiter in a hole-in-the-wall West Village trattoria that paid him under the table. Perhaps &#x201c;paid&#x201d; was a euphemism&#x2014;a teeny fraction of minimum wage&#x2014;but the tips were good. Everybody had heard Dylan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Positively 4th Street&#x201d; and all the tourists flocked to West 4th when they visited the Village. Trattoria Villagio waited there to provide drinks and light fare when they took a break from prowling the specialty shops.</p> <p>He checked his watch. Lots of time to kill before meeting a prospective customer at Julio&#x2019;s. Maybe he&#x2019;d grab a Whopper and train over to Brooklyn to check on an investment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by F.

The Forsyte Saga begins as the nineteenth century is drawing to a close, and the upper middle classes, with their property and propriety, are becoming a dying section of society. The Forsytes are blind to this fact, clinging to their conventions and &#x2018;brilliant respectability&#x2019;. As dignified Soames Forsyte struggles to uphold the old moral code in the face of the social revolution resulting from the Great War, his wife Irene&#x2019;s extraordinary beauty causes even more disruption. The bitter feud between them comes to split the Forsyte family for two generations.</p><p><b>John Galsworthy</b>&nbsp;(4 August 1867 &#x2013; 31 January 1933) was an English novelist and playwright.

Over sixty of her books have been published and reprinted in more than a dozen foreign languages. A single mother, she is a native of Oregon, where she still resides with her two teenage sons. Lisa is often asked what is the key to her success, and her unfailing answer is a keen imagination, incredible friends, loving family, and always, loads of laughter. As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said, &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;Eve Renner has amnesia, the result of being shot in an incident related to the murder of an old friend. Even worse, it's possible the killer is Cole Dennis, her boyfriend. After three months of not knowing what happened and staying away from her old life, she decides to go back to her house to face her fears. Then the violence starts all over again. Joyce Bean vividly portrays the mix of emotions in Eve and others who are drawn into the vortex of events. Through tempo and tone, Bean contrasts the increasing moments of suspense and fear with the decreasing moments of normalcy and calm.

What does it mean when a country tips its rubbish anywhere it likes? At the very least, it suggests that a modern Englishman&#39;s street has become his dining room...This short, brief book, then, sifts through the excesses of Britain&#39;s public &#39;dining room&#39; and analyses what litter says about our brave new world.

He was cruising along Highway 191, headed north through the most unpopulated part of Montana, when he saw her.<p>At first he blinked, convinced she had to be a mirage, since he hadn't even seen another car in hours. But there she was, standing beside the road, hip cocked, thumb out, a mane of long, ginger hair falling past her shoulders, blue jeans snug-fitting from her perfect behind down her impossibly long legs.</p><p>Jack slowed, already having doubts before he stopped next to her in his vintage, pale yellow Cadillac convertible. Just the sight of her kicked up the heat on an already warm May day.</p><p>She had a face that would make any man look twice. He watched her take in the restored convertible first then sweep her green-eyed gaze over him. He thought of warm, tropical sea breezes.</p><p>Until he looked closer. As warm as the day was, she wore a jean jacket, the collar turned up. He caught a glimpse of a stained T-shirt underneath. Her sneakers looked wet, like her hair. Her clothes were dusty and the cuffs of her jeans wet and muddy.</p><p>He'd seen an empty campground in the cottonwoods as he passed the Missouri River, but it was still early in this part of Montana to be camping, since the nights would be cold. It was especially too early to be bathing in the river, but he had to assume that was exactly what she'd done.</p><p>"Going any place in particular?" he asked, worried what she was doing out here in the middle of nowhere all alone. Assuming that was the case. He glanced toward the silky-green pine trees lining the road, half-expecting her boyfriend to come barreling out of them at any minute. But then, that was the way his suspicious mind worked.</p><p>"Up the highway." She leaned down to pick up the dirty backpack at her feet. It appeared as road worn as she was.</p><p>All Jack's instincts told him he'd regret giving this woman a ride. But it was what he glimpsed in her eyes that made up his mind. A little fear was normal for a woman traveling alone in the middle of nowhere. This woman was terrified of something.</p><p>He saw her glance back down the highway toward the river, that terror glittering in all that green.</p><p>"Then I guess you're going my way." He smiled, wondering what the hell this woman was running from and why he was opening himself up to it. Any fool knew that a woman on the run had trouble close at her heels. "Hop in."</p><p>She swung the backpack to her shoulder, straightened the collar of her jean jacket and shot another look back down the lonesome highway.</p><p>Jack glanced in his rearview, half-afraid of what had her so scared. Heat rose from the empty two-lane blacktop. He caught a glimpse of the river below them, the dark surface glistening in the morning sunlight. A hawk squawked as it soared on a current coming up out of the river. A cloud passed overhead, throwing the rugged ravines and gullies choked with scrub juniper and pine into shadow.</p><p>As he turned back, she was apologizing for her muddy sneakers.</p><p>"Don't worry about that," he said, figuring this woman had a lot more to worry about than getting his car dirty.</p><p>As he reached across to open her door, she dropped her backpack onto the passenger-side floorboard and slid into the seat, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Jack tried to shove off his second thoughts about picking up a total stranger on the run from beside the road in such a remote, isolated place as he watched her settle into the soft leather.</p><p>He couldn't miss the way she pulled her bulging backpack protectively between her feet. The backpack, like her T-shirt, was stained with dirt and splattered with something dark the color of dried blood.</p><p>"Name's Jack. Jack Winchester." Then he asked, "I'm on my way to the Winchester Ranch. You don't happen to know the Winchesters, do you?"</p><p>"I don't know a living soul in Montana." She took his outstretched hand. Her skin was silky smooth and just as cool. "Josey." Her eyes widened a little, as if that had just slipped out. "Josey Smith."</p><p>She'd stumbled on the last name, a clear lie. It made him wonder again who or what was after her. "Nice to meet you, Josey." He told himself he was just giving her a ride up the road as far as the turnoff to the ranch.</p><p>Shifting the Caddie into gear, he took off. As they topped the mountain and left the river and wild country of the Breaks behind, he saw her take one last look back. But the fear didn't leave her eyes as they roared down the long, empty highway.</p><p>Josey fought to still the frantic pounding of her heart. She didn't want this man to see how desperate she was. She was still shaking inside as she turned up the collar on her jean jacket and lay back against the seat.</p><p>She needed time to think. It still wasn't clear to her what had happened back there on the river.</p><p><i>Liar. </i>She closed her eyes, trying to block it all out. But the memory was too fresh. Just like the pain. She could still see the car breaking the dark green surface and sinking, hear the gurgling sound as water rushed in, see the huge bubbles that boiled to the surface.</p><p>She'd stumbled and fallen as she scaled the rocky bluff over the river, then worked her way through the pines, not daring to look back. She'd only just broken out of the trees and onto the highway when she'd heard the growl of an engine and spotted the Cadillac coming up the hill. It was the first vehicle she'd seen or heard in hours.</p><p>Holding her breath and reining in her urge to run, she'd stuck out her thumb&#x2014;and prayed. Her only hope was to get as far away as she could. She'd been scared the driver of the Cadillac wouldn't stop for her. She could just imagine the way she looked.</p><p>But he had stopped, she thought. That alone made her wary. She tried to concentrate on the warm spring breeze on her face, telling herself she was alive. It seemed a miracle. She'd gotten away. She was still shaking, though, still terrified after the horror of the past two days.</p><p>She opened her eyes, fighting the urge to look back down the highway again, and glanced over at the man who'd picked her up. Under normal circumstances she would have thought twice about getting into a car with a complete stranger, especially out here where there were no houses, no people, nothing but miles and miles of nothing.</p><p>Jack Winchester looked like a rancher in his jeans, boots, and fancy Western shirt. His dark blond hair curled at his nape under the black Stetson. She glanced down at her own clothing and cringed. She looked as if she'd been wallowing in the dirt. She had.</p><p>Furtively, she brushed at her jeans and, unable to refrain any longer, turned to look back down the highway.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>She felt tears sting her eyes. He wasn't coming after her. He couldn't ever hurt her again. She shuddered at the thought.</p><p>Not that it was over. By now California criminal investigators would have put out an all-points bulletin on her. Before long she'd be wanted in all fifty states for murder&#x2014;and they didn't know the half of it.</p><p>Ahead, the Little Rockies were etched purple against the clear blue sky of the spring day. As the land changed from the deep ravines and rocky ridges of the Missouri Breaks to the rolling prairie, Jack watched his passenger out of the corner of his eye. She chewed at her lower lip, stealing glances in the side mirror at the highway behind them. She had him looking back, as well.</p><p>Fortunately, the two-lane was empty.</p><p>As he neared the turnoff to the ranch, Jack realized he couldn't just put her out beside the road. He couldn't imagine how she came to be hitchhiking, but his every instinct told him she was in danger.</p><p>He could only assume it was from some man she'd hooked up with and later regretted. Whoever was after her, Jack didn't want him or her to catch up with his passenger.</p><p>He knew it was crazy. The last thing he needed was to get involved in this woman's problems. But he also didn't want her blood on his hands.</p><p>A thought crossed his mind. He prided himself at thinking on his feet. Also at using situations to his advantage.</p><p>And it appeared fate had literally dropped this woman into his lap. Or at least dropped her into his Caddie. Josey couldn't have been more perfect if he'd ordered her from a catalog. The more he thought about it, the more he liked his idea, and he wondered why he hadn't thought of it before he'd agreed to this visit to the "family" ranch.</p><p>He glanced over at her. She had her eyes closed again, her head back, her hair blowing behind her in a tangled wave of sun-kissed copper. She was stunning, but beyond that his instincts told him that this woman wasn't the type who normally found herself in this kind of position beside a road, and possibly running for her life.</p><p>Jack reminded himself that his instincts had also warned him not to pick her up back there.</p><p>He smiled to himself. Taking chances was nothing new to him, nor was charming his way to what he wanted. He'd been told that he could talk a rattlesnake out of its venom without even a bite. He knew he could talk this woman into what he had in mind or his name wasn't Jack Winchester.</p><p>But he didn't figure it would take much charming. He had a feeling she'd go for his proposal because she needed this more than he did.</p><p>"So, Josey, how do you feel about marriage?" he asked as they cruised down the vacant two-lane headed toward Whitehorse, Montana.</p><p><i>"Marriage?" </i>she asked, opening one eye.</p><p>Jack grinned. "I have a proposition for you."</p><p>Josey had been taken aback, instantly suspicious until he explained that he was on his way to see his grandmother, who was in her seventies.</p><p>"She has more money than she knows what to do with and lives on a huge ranch to the east of here," Jack said. "You'd be doing me a huge favor, and I'd make it worth your while. The ranch is sixty miles from the nearest town and a good ten from the nearest neighbor."</p><p>A remote ranch. Could she really get this lucky? He was offering her exactly what she needed, as if he knew how desperate she was. Was it that obvious?...</p></p><h2>My House</h2><p><p>Enter the world of Nikki Giovanni. Writing of mothers and their children, of childhood memories, of black leaders and black Africa, the poems in <em>My House</em> marked a new dimension in tone and philosophy for Nikki Giovanni when they first appeared at the beginning of her extraordinary career. Emotional and autobiographical, Nikki Giovanni personalizes the political--like no one else--and brings her house in all its complexity and glory to our own backyards. At once tough-minded and playful and with such famous classics as "My House" and "Winter Poem," this reissue of Nikki Giovanni's 1972 collection will once again intoxicate those who have always loved her poems--and those who are just getting to know her work.</p><p>As a witness to three generations, Nikki Giovanni has perceptively and poetically recorded her observations of both the outside world and the gentle yet enigmatic territory of the self. When her poems first emerged from the Black Rights Movement in the late 1960s, she immediately became a celebrated and controversial poet of the era. Written in one of the most commanding voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape at the end of the twentieth century, Nikki Giovanni's poems embody the fearless passion and spirited wit for which she is beloved and revered.</p>Nikki Giovanni is one of the most influential black writers writing today. This, her second book of poetry, marked a new dimension in tone and philosophy-personal and autobiographical rather than political; it is also lively, loving, witty, and occasionally tough-minded. Divided into two sections, the poems center around "her" house-the rooms inside as well as outside. She writes of mothers and their children, of childhood memories, of black leaders and black Africa. This is an important book by a black woman written in and of the '70s.<p>"Nikki Giovanni has . . . become one of the most potent voices of our time. Her message is universal and the rhythm and language of her poetry can be compared favorably with that of the finest poets of the past. She is a beautiful and complete human being with a genius for describing the human condition." <em> Minneapolis Tribune</em></p><p>"Talent is light, but mature talent is a beacon and Nikki Giovanni has, by her own words, joined that small band of talented people who try to show us all the way to go home." <em>Los Angeles Times</em></p></p><p><p>Nikki Giovanni, poet, activist, mother, and professor, is a seven-time NAACP Image Award winner and the first recipient of the Rosa Parks Woman of Courage Award, and holds the Langston Hughes Medal for Outstanding Poetry, among many other honors. The author of twenty-eight books and a Grammy nominee for <em>The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection</em>, she is the University Distinguished Professor of English at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.</p>Legaciesher grandmother called her from the playground<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"yes, ma'am"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"i want chu to learn how to make rolls" said the old<br>woman proudly<br>but the little girl didn't want <br>to learn how because she knew<br>even if she couldn't say it that <br>that would mean when the old one died she would be less<br>dependent on her spirit so<br>she said<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"i don't want to know how to make no rolls"<br>with her lips poked out<br>and the old woman wiped her hands on<br>her apron saying "lord<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these children"<br>and neither of them ever<br>said what they meant<br>and i guess nobody ever does<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[27 jan 72]</p><h2>Penguin English Library Howards End (The Penguin English Library)</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of Howards End by E. M. Forster &#39;The poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer. We rich can&#39; &#39;Only connect.&#39; is the idea at the heart of this book, a heartbreaking and provocative tale of three families at the beginning of the twentieth century: the rich Wilcoxes, the gentle, idealistic Schlegels and the lower-middle class Basts. As the Schlegel sisters try desperately to help the Basts and educate the close-minded Wilcoxes, the families are drawn together in love, lies and death. Frequently cited as E. M. Forster&#39;s finest work, Howards End brilliantly explores class warfare, conflict and the English character. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Margaret Schlegel, engaged to the much older, widowed Henry Wilcox, meets her intended the morning after accepting his proposal and realizes that he is a man who has lived without introspection or true self-knowledge. As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Kitty Goes to Washington (Kitty Norville)</h2><p>Celebrity werewolf and late-night radio host Kitty Norville prefers to be heard and not seen.

For almost a quarter of a century he had led the Universal Negro Improvement Association, at its peak the largest international mass movement in the history of African peoples. Now he wanted to pass on the lessons he had learned, to the group best suited to carry the struggle forward. For one month he instructed this elite student body, twevle hours a day, seven days a week. The sessions were secret and much of the instruction was not written down. The students did, however receive written copies of twenty-two lessons, which Garvey called the Course of African Philosophy. This fascinating distillation of a great leader&#39;s experience is published here for the first time.</p><p>The course of African Philosophy is a unique document. With the exception of his poetical works, it is the closest thing to a book that Marcus Garvey ever wrote. It represents, as it were the last political will and testament of a man who stands without equal in the history of the worldwide mobilization of African peoples. For Marcus Garvey did not merely organize the most massive Black movement in the history of the United States of America. He also organized the largest and most successful movement among African people in the Caribbean.</p><h2>Pacific Crest Trail: Southern California</h2><p>This comprehensive guide provides in-depth coverage of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mexican border to Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park.

Two minutes ago Elisa Michaels had finished the first grade. But even though she was cheering with all the other boys and girls as they rushed happily from the building, she still wished school weren't over. She could hardly wait until September, when second grade would begin. Second grade was much more grown-up than first!</p><p>Elisa's mother was waiting outside the school to walk her home. "You have a whole long summer vacation ahead of you," Mrs. Michaels said. "We'll have to think of some good things to keep you busy."</p><p>"Marshie, I'll be home to play with you every day," Elisa told her baby brother, whose real name was Marshall. He was being pushed along in his stroller. Marshall was only twenty months old. He still didn't say very much, but he could walk and run and follow Elisa around the house. He could dig in the sandbox at the park and build with blocks at home. Elisa thought it would be lots of fun to help take care of him during the summer.</p><p>Marshall banged on his stroller with the bagel he had been chewing. He was busy teething, and he didn't care about school and vacation time.</p><p>When they got to their apartment building, Elisa's big brother, Russell, who had his own key nowadays, was already home.</p><p>"Just four more days, and I'm off to sleepaway camp," he announced proudly.</p><p>Elisa had watched early in the month as her mother had packed and shipped off a big trunkful of clothing for Russell to wear during the three weeks he would be away from home. There were new T-shirts and new shorts, new socks and new underwear. In every piece of clothing Mrs. Michaels had attached a small label that read russell michaels in bright red letters.</p><p>Elisa wished she had a trunkful of new clothing with her name on every piece, but she was glad she wasn't going away from New York City to sleepaway camp. She wouldn't like to be separated from her parents and Marshall for so long. But Russell was much bigger. He was eleven years old, so he wanted to go away. At least he said he wanted to go away. Elisa wondered if he really and truly meant it.</p><p>Elisa thought it would be strange not to have Russell home for three whole weeks. But in a way it would be fun too. For three weeks she would be the oldest child in the family. For three weeks Russell wouldn't be around to boss and tease her. For three weeks she and Marshall would have their parents to themselves.</p><p>"I won't get homesick," Russell told his parents confidently.</p><p>"What's homesick?" Elisa asked.</p><p>"Homesick means that you miss your home," Mr. Michaels explained to his daughter.</p><p>"Won't you miss your home?" Elisa asked Russell.</p><p>"I don't think I'll miss you," he said. "It will be fun to live in a cabin with a bunch of other boys who are my age. We're going to have big adventures together."</p><p>"You may feel a tiny bit homesick at first," Mrs. Michaels told Russell. "But it will pass, and then you'll be home again before you know it."</p><p>"Be sure to write to me," Russell instructed his family on the morning he was leaving for camp.</p><p>Mrs. Michaels surprised him by saying, "I already did."</p><p>"Why did you write to Russell when he's still here?" Elisa asked.</p><p>"I mailed a letter to the camp. I knew it would be fun for him to get mail as soon as he arrived."</p><p>"What did you say in it?" Russell wanted to know.</p><p>"You'll have to wait and read the letter," said Mrs. Michaels.</p><p>"I wish you'd write me a letter," Elisa said to her mother.</p><p>"Someday when you go to camp, I'll send letters to you there," her mother replied. But Elisa wasn't at all sure it would be worth going away from home for so long just to receive mail of her own.</p><p>"You write to me too, Elisa," Russell requested. "I want lots of letters."</p><p>"Okay, I will," she promised her brother. She hoped something exciting would happen so she could write about it.</p><p>As soon as Mr. Michaels took Russell to the bus terminal, Elisa ran to get a piece of paper and a pencil. She sat down at the kitchen table and began writing. "Dear Russell," she wrote. "I hope you are having a good time at camp." She stopped to look at her words. That's silly, she thought. How can Russell be having a good time? He hasn't even gotten on the bus yet. Elisa scrunched up the paper into a ball and threw it in the garbage. She would write a letter to Russell tomorrow.</p><p>Supper without Russell wasn't too strange. It was as if he were having a sleepover at a friend's house. But when Russell didn't come home the next day, it felt different.</p><p>"I wonder what Russell's doing at camp," Elisa said to her mother.</p><p>"You could write him a letter and ask," Mrs. Michaels suggested.</p><p>Elisa pulled out a sheet of paper. "Dear Russell," she wrote. "Is camp fun? I've been having fun playing with Annie." Elisa stopped writing. Russell wouldn't care that she had gone to the playground yesterday. She went to the playground all the time. She wished she had something new and special to write about. She scrunched up the paper into a ball and threw it in the garbage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Hail Holy Queen: An Explanation of the Salve Regina</h2><p>The first part of St. Alphonsus&#39; masterpiece; The Glories of Mary; collected from the Saints; Doctors of the Church and other holy authors.

George Martin&#x2019;s working-class childhood and musical influences profoundly shaped his early career in the BBC&#x2019;s Classical Music department and as head of the EMI Group&#x2019;s Parlophone Records. Out of them flowed the genius behind his seven years producing the Beatles&#x2019; incredible body of work, including such albums as <i>Rubber Soul</i>, <i>Revolver,</i><i>Sgt.

In its most dramatic moments, <i>Maximum Volume</i> narrates the story of Martin&#x2019;s unlikely discovery of the Beatles and his painstaking efforts to prepare their newfangled sound for the British music marketplace.

During the Cretan revolt of 1897 his family was sent to the island of Naxos, where he attended the French School of the Holy Cross. From 1902 to 1906 he studied law at Athens University. He worked first as a journalist and throughout a long career wrote several plays, travel journals and translations. His remarkable travels began in 1907 and there were few countries in Europe or Asia that he didn&#39;t visit. He studied Buddhism in Vienna and later belonged to a group of radical intellectuals in Berlin, where he began his great epic The Odyssey, which he completed in 1938. He didn&#39;t start writing novels until he was almost 60 and completed his most famous work, Zorba the Greek, in 1946.

It was created to serve as a springboard for parents and educators to facilitate tough conversations with their kids about race, privilege and oppression. Race Cars tells the story of 2 best friends, a white car and a black car, that have different experiences and face different rules while entering the same race.</p><p>*Updated version now includes discussion guide and questions to help parents and educators facilitate conversations with children. </p><p>Why is this book important?</p><p>As early as 6 months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, by ages 2 to 4, children can internalize racial bias and start assigning meaning to race. 5 to 8-year-olds begin to place value judgments on similarities and differences. By age 12 children have a complete set of stereotypes about every racial, ethnic, and religious group in society. Our guidance is especially crucial during this impressionable time. Race Cars offers a simplistic, yet powerful way to introduce these complicated themes to our children and is a worthy addition to classroom and home libraries.</p><p>About the author and illustrator</p><p>Jenny Devenny, LMSW is a Clinical Social Worker living and practicing in Brooklyn, New York.

Readers may contact her via e-mail at robinlee@robinleehatcher.com.Gabe Talmadge is on his way home to Depression-era Ransom, Idaho, after a long spell in jail for a crime he did not commit. Hungry and exhausted, he collapses just 15 miles from his father's mansion. Beautiful, devout Akira Macauley takes him in, giving him a home-cooked meal and a clean bed for the night. The next day she drives him to town, where he asks his wealthy but cruel father, Hudson Talmadge, for a job. After Hudson turns him out, Akira rescues Gabe once again, offering him a job on her sheep farm. Akira's friends worry about her safety, but Akira believes God has sent Gabe to her farm so that he can recuperate, body and soul. Indeed, Gabe gains back his physical strength and rededicates his life to the Lord. Not surprisingly, he and Akira fall in love. Hatcher eschews subtlety here: Akira the Shepherdess recalls Psalm 23, and Gabe is part prodigal son, part heralding angel. And if readers do not figure out that Ransom is more than just the name of a townAit is also Jesus' roleAveteran romance novelist Hatcher liberally sprinkles clues in the form of biblical quotations . Still, the predictable plot is entertaining, and Gabe and Akira are appealing, albeit somewhat one-dimensional, characters.

From breakfast to soups, mains to grains, vegetables to desserts, this guide is the only book you'll ever need to master your slow cooker or crockpot.</b><br><br>Millions of people are turning to slow cookers for their weeknight meals yet often can't find recipes that match their exact machine. Adapting recipes meant for a different-size cooker doesn't work--getting the right level of spice in your Vietnamese soup or keeping pulled pork tender requires having ingredients in the right proportion. But now, Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough have decoded slow cookers, and each of their recipes includes ingredient proportions for 2-3 quart, 4-5 quart, and 6-8 quart machines, guaranteeing a perfect fit no matter what machine you own. Each recipe is labeled for its level of difficulty and nutritional value, and they cover every kind of dish imaginable: delicious breakfast oatmeals, slow-braised meats, succulent vegetables, sweet jams and savory sauces, decadent desserts. This is the slow cooker book to end them all.</p><p>BRUCE WEINSTEIN and MARK SCARBROUGH are the creators of the bestselling <i>Ultimate Cookbook</i> series (on subjects as diverse as pizza, ham, candy, shrimp, and peanut butter) and have most recently published <i>Goat: Meat, Milk, Cheese</i> and <i>Grain Mains. </i>They were nominated for a James Beard award in 2011, and are regular contributors to Weight Watchers.com and<i> Eating Well, Cooking Light, </i>and the <i>Washington Post.</i>introduction<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve got a slow cooker, raise your hand. Yep, we thought so. Almost everyone. Over 80 percent of U.S. households own this appliance. To put that into perspective, more people in America own a slow cooker than own a coffee maker.<br><br>And it&#x2019;s not just households. We live in rural New �En�gland, near a small general �store&#x2014;�the type that serves coffee and pastries all morning, and lunches until �mid-�afternoon&#x2014;�with loggers, retired bankers, plumbers, and �trust-�fund �ne&#x2019;er-�do-�wells sitting �higgledy-�piggledy around the room at wooden tables. There&#x2019;s always a slow cooker or two on the counter, stocked with some spiky chili or a warm, smooth vegetable soup.<br><br>If truth be told, the slow cooker is the best device for preparing a deep, complex stew; a hot-�breakfast-�is-�ready-�when-�your-�alarm-�rings miracle; a �dinner-�is-�ready-�when-�you-�get-�home wonder; a surprisingly successful cake or steamed pudding; and fare as diverse as a �dried-�fruit compote (perfect on ice cream or oatmeal) or a hot toddy punch that&#x2019;ll knock your lights out when you need them so knocked.<br><br>Even so, why did we decide to tackle a slow cooker book? We got tired of recipes that cut us out of the mix. For years, we had a �7-�quart model. (Yes, for two people. Yes, we&#x2019;re big eaters. If you invite us over, double your recipe.) We&#x2019;d look through books and articles to discover that, while some of the recipes were made for the bigger models, most were made for the �4-�quart slow �cookers&#x2014;�despite the fact that these smaller guys represent just one slice of the bigger pie. We �couldn&#x2019;t very well make such puny fare in our ginormous machine. So we slimmed down and bought a 21/2-�quart model, mostly for oatmeal and hot cereals on cold mornings, but also to keep the servings more in the range of normal. Again, our slow cooker �didn&#x2019;t fit most of the recipes out there. A standard braise swamped it. Slow cooker recipe yields �didn&#x2019;t seem to be changing, despite the fact that �so-�called nuclear households were shrinking (just 2.48 members these days), while blended and extended families were steadily growing. That �4-�quart, �mid-�range model is no longer a �one-�size-�fits-�all for the American scene.<br><br>So we decided to do something about it. We decided to write a book in which almost every recipe can be made by a range of models: small ones that are 2 to 31/2 quarts; medium ones that are 4 to 51/2 quarts; and large ones that are 6 to 8 quarts. We set aside a year, blew off our waistlines, and crafted a book that can be used by anyone, no matter what model is in the cabinet. And thus, almost anyone who has a slow cooker can use almost all of these recipes.<br><br>We&#x2019;re not leaving anyone �out&#x2014;�or ignoring any situation. Maybe you, too, need a smaller model for those nights when the house has quieted down to just the two of �you&#x2014;�and none of your old recipes work. Or maybe you need a gargantuan vat of a slow cooker meal because you&#x2019;ve suddenly found yourself in a world of potluck dinners and church socials. We hear your pain. We&#x2019;ve got your back.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re new to this game of cooking (welcome!), or if you&#x2019;ve just received your first slow cooker as a wedding or graduation gift (congratulations!), you&#x2019;ll want to start simple: a classic Minestrone (page 000) or perhaps �Garlic-�Roasted Chicken Drumsticks (page 000), or Mushroom Sloppy Joes (page 000). If you&#x2019;re an old hand around the kitchen, someone who knows the difference between parsley and chervil, you&#x2019;ll want to head for the Oxtails Braised in Red Wine with Carrots and Prunes (page 000) or even the Pork Mole Rojo with Plantains (page 000). In any event, let&#x2019;s start cooking.<br><br>why you should use a slow cooker<br><br>It&#x2019;s true: you won&#x2019;t see many slow cookers on the top food shows. But you will see them in many professional kitchens around the country. Chefs love the way the appliance blends the flavors of a soup or sauce, then holds the concoction at a safe temperature for hours.<br><br>You need to get in on the game. There&#x2019;s no other appliance that retains as much natural moisture in �dishes&#x2014;�not your oven, not your grill, not your smoker. No wonder, then, that slow cookers make the best braises, the creamiest soups, and the finest stews. Think of this appliance as an �old-�fashioned take on �ultra-�modern �sous-�vide cooking: hours at a low temperature under a tight lid. Chicken comes out moist and flavorful every time. Carrots stay plump and juicy. Pulled pork is outrageous.<br><br>That said, you don&#x2019;t need to try to do what a slow cooker can&#x2019;t. You won&#x2019;t find a roasted beef tenderloin here. Or fried fish. But you will find �cakes&#x2014;�yep, a slow cooker holds that moisture so well that it can turn out some of the finest coffeecakes around. And it makes pudding in a flash, no stirring needed. If you �really want to go over the top, wait until you try our recipe for Salmon Poached in Olive Oil (page 000). That alone might be a reason for this appliance.<br><br>There are no perfect solutions in this world, nor perfect appliances. But there are ways to get around the machine&#x2019;s sticking points. �Here&#x2019;s how.<br><br>solving some problems<br><br>Times have changed since those first slow cookers came off the assembly line in the 1970s. More important, slow cookers have changed. For better meals in this �post-�disco world, we&#x2019;ve got to make some adjustments.<br><br>By and large, �twenty-�first-century slow cookers run hotter. A friend of ours says that she can never get a �low-�bubble simmer in her �new-�model slow cooker. She&#x2019;s resurrected her vintage, �harvest-�gold one from the back cabinet and now spends her life scouring garage sales to find replacement parts. Despite such heroic efforts to stave off progress, she might as well face the facts and modify her expectations.<br><br>In reality, temperature&#x2019;s not the pressing concern; food safety is. Nobody should have a vat of chicken soup sitting below 140�F for hours: all sorts of bad bacteria will sprout to life. Since the cooking temperature of modern slow cookers was ratcheted up to address this problem, we need to make a bunch of modifications. Specifically, we need to<br><br>1. Up the liquid to compensate for a slightly more intense bubbling.<br><br>2. Completely forget about veal chops and other cuts of meat that dry out quickly.<br><br>3. Go for cheaper cuts like brisket and pork shoulder (which taste better anyway).<br><br>4. Set a more precise time marker on the recipe; the old days of the big swings in recipe timings (&#x201c;cook on low for 9 to 12 hours&#x201d;) are, like bipartisan compromise, a fond memory.<br><br>Modern slow cookers come in multiple sizes. As this appliance began to fan out across the land in the 1980s and &#x2019;90s, its size both grew and shrank to meet everyone&#x2019;s needs. So what happens if you have a �4-�quart and the recipe calls for a �6-�quart? We solved that problem by offering almost all of our �recipes in three sizes: a chart of ingredients that states what you need for a small slow cooker, a medium slow cooker, and a large model.<br><br>By the way, it&#x2019;s not just math to convert a recipe to different size yields: some spices have an exponential affect. For example, you can&#x2019;t just double or triple the ground cumin without annihilating other flavors. Likewise, doubling or tripling the oil can lead to a greasy mess. Two cups of broth may be right for a small cooker; eight cups would swamp a large model.<br><br>In modern slow cookers, the flavors meld, but not always in a good way. Frankly, a slow cooker stew can be like melted crayons. You start out with pink, green, blue, and yellow; you end up with brown. That �doesn&#x2019;t sound like a rousing endorsement (unless you like brown). But there&#x2019;s no use in not facing �facts&#x2014;�flavors can lose their spiky or shallow notes. A few tablespoons of minced oregano leaves will brighten a pot of rag� on the stove; they&#x2019;ll dissolve into an herby haze in a modern slow cooker, little more than the notion of oregano. �What&#x2019;s more, bold flavors, whether acidic or sweet (tomatoes or carrots, as well as maple syrup and lemon juice) can TKO the lithe subtleties of thyme or parsley. Cinnamon will knock out black pepper; brown sugar, blueberries. In other words, the ends of the flavor spectrum vanquish the middle. So we put velvet covers over certain flavor sledgehammers, like salt, vinegar, or ground cardamom. And we goose the shy flavors to get them to speak. (We&#x2019;re looking at you, thyme.) In fact, we goose more than we cover. �Life&#x2019;s too short for pallid food.<br><br>Our Charts Have Wiggle Room<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve got a �6-�quart model and you need to feed four, with one serving of leftovers for lunch tomorrow, use the ingredient amounts for the medium slow cooker �(4-� to �5�-�quart) in your model if (and it&#x2019;s an important if) you&#x2019;re making a soup, stew, or braise. However, you cannot swap sizes for gooey casseroles, baked goods, or puddings. Of those, you&#x2019;ll just have leftovers for the days ahead.<br><br>Stock Up on Herbs and Spices<br><br>If there&#x2019;s one thing this book will do, it will help you build a better spice cabinet. You&#x2019;ll need a good range of choices to complete some of these recipes. We may have nixed lots of gourmet ingredients in this �book&#x2014;�no Shaoxing, no foie �gras&#x2014;�but we �didn&#x2019;t stint on the dried herbs and spices. Slow cookers can wear them out; we beefed them up for battle.<br><br>Top Seven Tips for Slow Cookers<br><br>�Lift the lid as little as possible. Modern slow cookers restabilize the temperature more quickly than old models, but peeking is still discouraged unless you see a problem.<br><br>�Stir only when the recipe asks you to. The less action, the better.<br><br>�Don&#x2019;t overfill the cooker. Half to �two-�thirds full is best, although some soups can fill it up more without dinging their success.<br><br>�Thaw frozen ingredients. Use frozen or even partially thawed ingredients only when specifically requested by the recipe.<br><br>�When in doubt, overseason but undersalt. Slow cookers eat the flavors of herbs but amplify the taste of salt.<br><br>�Treat the cooker gently. To keep ceramic inserts from cracking because of abrupt temperature changes, place a kitchen towel under an insert before setting it on a cold, granite counter.<br><br>�Clean the cooker thoroughly between uses. Don&#x2019;t use steel wool. We fill ours with water, set it aside to soak, and then wipe it out before putting the canister in the dishwasher. Read the instructions for your model to see if it&#x2019;s �dishwasher-�safe.<br><br>our commitments to you<br><br>When we set out to develop the recipes for this book, we laid down some ground �rules&#x2014;�which we came to see as the �book&#x2019;s promises.<br><br>Only real food. Yes, slow cookers came on the scene in a time of canned this and cream of that. The appliance moved on, adding features and becoming energy efficient. Unfortunately, many recipes �didn&#x2019;t. They still call for processed ingredients: dry soup mixes, taco flavorings, and other chemical miasma.<br><br>We shun most processed food. Yes, we occasionally call for canned broth, tomatoes, and even some frozen vegetables. But we&#x2019;ve left out most convenience products and condiments that would up the fakery of these dishes. We&#x2019;ve read the labels and decided on products that are no different in their convenience form than if we&#x2019;d made them ourselves. So pickle relish and prepared horseradish are in; marinated chicken tenders and �fat-�free Italian dressing are out. We&#x2019;ve gone �real&#x2014;�or as real as we can without milling flour and canning tomatoes. There&#x2019;s no &#x201c;cream of&#x201d; anything here. But we&#x2019;ve kept our rule in check. For example, a bottled Italian dried spice blend is no more than the sum of the dried spices themselves. It&#x2019;s in.<br><br>Only ingredients from your local supermarket. These recipes do not require a trip to a �high-�end grocery supermarket or a specialty grocery store. We won&#x2019;t call for ajwain seeds or goat shoulder. Sure, there are �Asian-�style braises here, even a massaman curry; but we only call for the Asian condiments found in the typical international aisle of a North American supermarket, like hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, coconut milk, and soy sauce. But that �doesn&#x2019;t mean we can&#x2019;t produce a �tongue-�snapping, �Sichuan-�style dish.<br><br>We live in backwoods New �En�gland. The closest grocery store is a long drive down country roads. It&#x2019;s not a �high-�end store but also not a �mom-�and-�pop joint; it&#x2019;s a large supermarket that caters to a rural population. We geared every recipe to that store. Yes, there may be a few things at our supermarket that �aren&#x2019;t at yours. But we doubt it, unless you live in an even more rural spot than we do. (Do you, too, stake flapping plastic bags on tall poles to chase the moose away from your elderberry bushes?)<br><br>Modern American dishes. This is a book for a distinctly American appliance, but that �doesn&#x2019;t mean we have to stick to hamburger casseroles. These days, we live among many cultures, each with its own tradition. And we can relish each other&#x2019;s food: Chinese braises, Indian curries, Southern stews, Yankee pot roast, Jewish brisket, Polish sausage. Our recipes run the gamut of American cultures, from the new to the �old-�fashioned. In that way, we can celebrate the new American century.<br><br>Only basic kitchen gadgetry. When slow cooker recipes step away from the �cream-�of-�whatever, they can devolve into culinary esoterica. We&#x2019;re always amazed at recipes that require us to build some sort of �aluminum-�foil pyre inside a slow cooker. Frankly, we don&#x2019;t see the point. Yes, we might be able to lift a chicken out of its juices as it roasts. But if truth be told, we&#x2019;re not �really worried about air circulation in a slow cooker. It&#x2019;s not worth the time to raise a bird up when it will not get crisp in the cooker the way it would in an oven. Yes, some of the meat will sit down in those juices as it cooks. But is that a bad thing?<br><br>We wanted the slow cooker to be the appliance at hand. Yes, some recipes require a standard blender or an immersion blender. No more than a handful ask for a food processor. And yes, a few baking recipes do call for one specific piece of equipment: a �1-�quart, �high-�sided, souffl� or baking dish. But those items are available at our local supermarket among the cookware equipment. (Don&#x2019;t worry: in many of these baking recipes, we advocate pouring the batter right into the cooker itself.)

Serge Lemoine, curator of the exhibition and director of the Mus�e d'Orsay, proposes that "modern art does not descend, as is commonly thought, from Manet and Impressionism, but from . . . the French painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes (1824-1898)." The author of monumental mural decorations in such civic buildings as the museums of Amiens, Lyons, Rouen, the Panth�on and the Sorbonne, Puvis de Chavannes had a remarkable influence on his contemporaries in France and abroad, including Seurat, Gauguin and C�zanne, as well as on later generations of artists. Equally indebted to Puvis de Chavannes are the great European symbolist painters, from Munch to Hodler. However, perhaps his most prestigious modern acolytes were Picasso and Matisse, who remained loyal to him all their lives.<br><br>This volume features detailed scholarly contributions analyzing Puvis de Chavannes's work and all his affiliations, as well as offering rich critical and documentary data on his numerous and notable disciples. Accompanied by over five hundred illustrations, this volume is a superb evocation of a period of great artistic ferment and outstanding creativity.<br><br>A landmark study, <i>Toward Modern Art</i> makes the bold argument that modern art does not descend, as is commonly described, from Manet and Impressionism, but rather from the unlikely figure of French painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes (1824-1898). This gorgeously illustrated volume with over 500 full color illustrations, was organized by Serge Lemoine, director of Mus�e d'Orsay in Paris, and includes over 15 essays by distinguished writers. Lemoine's side-by-side comparisons and expert commentary bear witness to his groundbreaking thesis.<br></p><p>Serge Lemoine is director of the Mus�e d&#39;Orsay.This catalog for a monumental show at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice focuses on the importance of Puvis de Chavannes in the development of modern sensibilities by showing his works alongside those of many artists from Europe and North America who were influenced by him. In the opening essay, Lemoine (director, Musee D'Orsay) argues for Puvis's rightful place as the father of modern painting. Nineteen additional essays by important scholars discuss Puvis's murals and easel paintings, located in many major public spaces in France. Respected by contemporaries Degas and Rodin, Puvis influenced younger artists from C zanne and Gauguin to Matisse and Picasso, as well as the Pre-Raphaelites, the Nabis, and other modern movements in many countries. The catalog of works contains more than 500 color illustrations of the massive amount of art assembled for the show, much of it from the Musee D'Orsay. A final important feature includes biographies of every artist in the show. Puvis is still best described by famed art critic Bernard Berenson in his 1897 essay on space composition in della Francesca and Perugino.

They generally retain the shape and fragrance of the Old Roses, while keeping the disease resistance and perpetual bloom of the Moderns, although as the illustrations show, there is considerable divergence among individual varieties. Austin tells how he began creating English Roses, describes their characteristics, and suggests how best to use and care for them. The book is rounded off by individual portraits of each variety with specifics of size, fragrance, hardiness, and parentage. A list of suppliers follows. This will probably not be the last word on English Roses, especially on their care, but it is an excellent introduction to this new group of roses, beautifully presented in Perry's photographs.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural.

For this reason, the talks and interviews collected here are of the greatest help to other seekers of truth. Whether writing about Gurdjieff or ancient world traditions, Tracol skillfully draws from a vast knowledge of them and of his own and other cultures. He brings archetypes and heroes close enough for the reader to see more clearly what they represent, reveals that help is at hand from sacred sources, and that it is possible to penetrate the genesis of the common essence of traditional wisdom. This newly revised and expanded edition includes two of Tracol&#x2019;s earlier works <i>The Taste for Things That are True</i> and <i>Further Talks and Essays</i> in their entirety, as well as previously unpublished material from his many visits to the United States in the 1970s and 1980s and all of his remarkable contributions to <i>Parabola</i> during the same period.</p><p>Sculptor, writer, voyager, journalist, and photographer who once worked at the Mus�e de l&#x2019;Homme in Paris, with anthropologists and geographers among his admired ancestors, and with his unflagging interest in the ongoing creating of the creation, Henri Tracol could perhaps be called a Renaissance man.&#x201d;<br><br>Tracol characterizes what is essential in the Gurdjieff teaching as a call to place myself interiorly in relation to what presents itself from the outside.&#x201d; He emphasizes that this teaching guards against dependence on credulity, dogma and subjectivity.</p><h2>It&#39;s a Bitter Little World: The Smartest, Toughest, Nastiest Quotes From Film Noir</h2><p><b>Learn Life's Hard Lessons from Film Noir</b><p>&amp;break;&amp;break;If you want to know the meaning of life, don't study Shakespeare, don't peruse Plato.

Lippard and major writers on environmental art and climate change. It was published by the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art (in Colorado) as part of the 2007 exhibit "Weather Report: Art and Climate Change," curated by internationally renowned art critic, historian, and writer Lucy R. Lippard. "Weather Report" underscores art's potential to educate and motivate audiences. Issues regarding desertification, floods, changing watersheds, global warming, renewable energy, carbon profiling, reforestation, species transformation, ozone layer, ocean acidification, and soil subsidence are presented through artists eyes to provoke a tangible, immediate connection with the viewer. The intent of the exhibit was to partner the scientific and art communities to create a visual dialogue surrounding climate change. The artists include: Kim Abeles, Lillian Ball, Subhankar Banerjee, Iain Baxter&amp;, Bobbe Besold, Cape Farewell, Mary Ellen Carroll (Precipice Alliance), CLUI (Center for Land Use Interpretation), Brian Collier, Xavier Cortada, Gayle Crites, Agnes Denes, Steven Deo, Rebecca DiDomenico, Future Farmers (Amy Franceschini and Michael Swaine), Bill Gilbert, Isabella Gonzales, Green Fabrication University of Colorado College of Architecture and Planning (Professor, Rick Sommerfeld), Newton Harrison &amp; Helen Mayer Harrison, Judit Hersko, Lynne Hull, Pierre Huyghe, Basia Irland, Patricia Johanson, Chris Jordan, Marguerite Kahrl, Janet Koenig &amp; Greg Sholette, Eve Andree Laramee, Learning Site (Cecilia Wendt and Rikke Luther), Ellen Levy, Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, Patrick Marold, Natasha Mayers, Jane McMahan, Mary Miss, Joan Myers, Beverly Naidus, Chrissie Orr, Melanie Walker &amp; George Peters, Andrea Polli, Marjetica Potrc, Aviva Rahmani, Rapid Response, Buster Simpson, Kristine Smock, Joel Sternfeld, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Ruth Wallen, Sherry Wiggins, The Yes Men, and Shai Zakai.</p><p>Lucy R.

The idea of castle architecture in America is not a new one. Many of the castles depicted here were constructed long ago, after the Revolutionary War and after the Civil War. Most of them were built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with one, Chateau Laroche, still in process of being built at the time of this writing....Many of these castles still exist today and are open to the public. Amidst the turrets, battlements, great halls, and often unique interiors, the sense of being back in days of old is keenly felt. More than 250 illustrations bring to life the marvelous detail in design, as well as the splendor or simplicity of the interior furnishings of these castles, giving the reader a sense of the elegance of one of America&#39;s little-known forms of architecture.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Kiss of the Spider Woman</h2><p>Sometimes they talk all night long. In the still darkness of their cell, Molina re-weaves the glittering and fragile stories of the film he loves, and the cynical Valentin listens. Valentin believes in the just cause which makes all suffering bearable; Molina believes in the magic of love which makes all else endurable. Each has always been alone, and always - especially now - in danger of betrayal. But in cell, each surrenders to the other something of himself that he has never surrendered before.</p><p>Manuel Puig was born in 1932 in a small town in the Argentine pampas. He studied philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires, and in 1956 won a scholarship from the Italian Institute in Buenos Aires and chose to pursue studies in film direction at the Cinecitta in Rome. There he worked in films until 1962, when he began to write his first novel. Exiled from Argentina, he settled in New York City in 1963. Puig&#39;s novels - Betrayed by Rita Hayworth, Heartbreak Tango, The Buenos Aires Affair, Kiss of the Spider Woman and Eternal Curse on the Reader of These Pages - have been translated into fourteen languages and secured his international reputation.

His originality, bravery, range, and wit made him first a leading iconoclast of the political left and then, later in his career, a formidable advocate of secular liberalism. When the Twin Towers were attacked in September 2001, Hitchens was re-energised again, quickly emerging as one of the fiercest and most influential advocates of war on Iraq. In this long-awaited and candid memoir, Hitchens re-traces the footsteps of his life to date, from his childhood in Portsmouth, with his adoring, tragic mother and reserved Naval officer father; to his life in Washington DC, the base from which from he would launch fierce attacks on tyranny of all kinds. Along the way, he recalls the girls, boys and booze; the friendships and the feuds; the grand struggles and lost causes; and, the mistakes and misgivings that have characterised his life. &#34;Hitch-22&#34; is, by turns, moving and funny, charming and infuriating, enraging and inspiring. It is an indispensable companion to the life and thought of our pre-eminent political writer.</p><p>Christopher Hitchens (1949-2011) was a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and a columnist for Slate. He was the author of numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, George Orwell, Mother Teresa, Henry Kissinger and Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as his international bestseller and National Book Award nominee, god Is Not Great. His memoir, Hitch-22, which was a Sunday Times bestseller, was nominated for the Orwell Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. His last book, Mortality, was published in 2012 by Atlantic Books.<b>Yvonne</b><br>There is always a moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in . . .<br>&#x2014; Graham Greene: <i>The Power and the Glory</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Something I owe to the soil that grew &#x2014;<br>More to the life that fed &#x2014;<br>But most to <i>Allah </i>who gave me two<br>Separate sides to my head.<br>&#x2014; Rudyard Kipling: <i>Kim </i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I OF COURSE do not believe that it is &#x201c;Allah&#x201d; who determines these things. (Salman Rushdie, commenting on my book <i>god Is Not Great</i>, remarked rather mordantly that the chief problem with its title was a lack of economy: that it was in other words exactly one word too long.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But whatever one&#x2019;s ontology may be, it will always seem tempting to believe that everything must have a first cause or, if nothing quite as grand as that, at the very least a definite beginning. And on that point I have no vagueness or indecision. I do know a little of how I came to be in two minds. And <i>this </i>is how it begins with me:<br>&nbsp;<br>I am standing on a ferry-boat that is crossing a lovely harbor. I have since learned many versions and variations of the word &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; but let&#x2019;s say that a brilliant if slightly harsh sunshine illuminates a cerulean sky-vault and an azure sea and also limns the way in which these two textures collide and reflect. The resulting tinge of green is in lambent contrast with the darker vegetation on the hillsides and makes an almost blinding combination when, allied with those discrepant yet melding blues, it hits the white buildings that reach down to the edge of the water. As a flash of drama and beauty and seascape and landscape, it&#x2019;s as good an inaugural memory as one could wish.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since this little voyage is occurring in about 1952 and I have been born in 1949, I have no means of appreciating that this is the Grand Harbor at Valletta, the capital of the tiny island-state of Malta and one of the finest Baroque and Renaissance cities of Europe. A jewel set in the sea between Sicily and Libya, it has been for centuries a place of the two-edged sword between the Christian and Muslim worlds. Its population is so overwhelmingly Roman Catholic that there are, within the walled city, a great plethora of ornate churches, the cathedral being decorated by the murals of Caravaggio himself, that seductive votary of the higher wickedness. The island withstood one of the longest Turkish sieges in the history of &#x201c;Christendom.&#x201d; But the Maltese tongue is a dialect version of the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb and is the only Semitic language to be written in a Latin script. If you happen to attend a Maltese Catholic church during Mass, you will see the priest raising the Communion Host and calling on &#x201c;Allah,&#x201d; because this after all is the local word for &#x201c;god.&#x201d; My first memory, in other words, is of a ragged and jagged, but nonetheless permeable and charming, frontier between two cultures and civilizations.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am, at this stage, far too secure and confident to register anything of the kind. (If I speak a few phrases of Maltese, it is not with a view to becoming bilingual or multicultural but in order to address my priest-ridden nannies and the kitchen maids with their huge broods of children. This was the place where I first learned to see the picture of Catholicism as one of plump shepherds and lean sheep.) * Malta is effectively a British colony &#x2014; its most heroic recent chapter the withstanding of a hysterical aerial bombardment by Hitler and Mussolini &#x2014; and it has remained a solid possession of the Royal Navy, in which my father proudly serves, ever since the Napoleonic Wars. Much more to the immediate point, I am standing on the deck of this vessel in company with my mother, who holds my hand when I desire it and also lets me scamper off to explore if I insist.<br>&nbsp;<br>* Everything about Christianity is contained in the pathetic image of &#x201c;the flock.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, all things being considered, not too shaky a start. I am well-dressed and well-fed, with a full head of hair and a slender waist, and operating in a context of startling architectural and natural beauty, and full of <i>brio </i>and self-confidence, and on a boat in the company of a beautiful woman who loves me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t call her by this name at the time, but &#x201c;Yvonne&#x201d; is the echo with which I most piercingly and yearningly recall her memory to me. After all, it <i>was </i>her name, and it was what her friends called her, and my shell-like ear detected quite early on a difference between this and the various comfortable Nancys and Joans and Ethels and Marjories who &#x2014; sterling types all &#x2014; tended to be the spouses and helpmeets of my father&#x2019;s brother-officers. <i>Yvonne </i>. A bit of class there: a bit of style. A touch or dash of garlic and olive and rosemary to sweeten the good old plain English loaf from which, the fact must be faced, I was also sliced. But more of this when I come to Commander Hitchens. I mustn&#x2019;t pretend to remember more than I really do, but I am very aware that it makes a great difference to have had, in early life, a passionate lady in one&#x2019;s own corner.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, noticing that I had skipped the baby-talk stage and gone straight to speaking in complete sentences (even if sometimes derivative ones such as, according to family legend, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all go and have a drink at the club&#x201d;), she sat me down one day and produced an elementary phonetic reading-book, or what used to be known to the humble as &#x201c;a speller.&#x201d; This concerned the tedious adventures of a woodland elf or goblin called Lob-agob (his name helpfully subdivided in this way) but, by the time I was done with it, I was committed for life to having some sort of reading matter within reach at all times, and was always to be ahead of my class in reading-age.<br>&nbsp;<br>By this period, however, our family had left Malta and been posted to the much more austere surroundings of Rosyth, another naval base on the east coast of Scotland. I think Malta may have been a sort of high point for Yvonne: all British people were a cut above the rest in a semicolony and there was that club for cocktails and even the chance of some local &#x201c;help.&#x201d; Not that she longed to wallow in idleness but, having endured a girlhood of scarcity, slump, and then war, she couldn&#x2019;t have minded a bit of color and Mediterranean dash and may well have felt she&#x2019;d earned it. (On our way back from Malta we stopped for a few hours at Nice: her and my first taste of the Riviera. I remember how happy she looked.) The grayness and drabness of &#x201c;married quarters&#x201d; in drizzle-flogged Fifeshire must have hit her quite hard.<br>&nbsp;<br>But she and my father had first been thrown together precisely because of drizzle and austerity, and the grim, grinding war against the Nazis. He, a career Navy man, had been based at Scapa Flow, the huge, cold-water sound in the Orkney Islands which helped establish and maintain British control over the North Sea. She was a volunteer in the Women&#x2019;s Royal Naval Service or, in the parlance of the day, a &#x201c;Wren.&#x201d; (My most cherished photograph of her shows her in uniform.) After a short wartime courtship they had been married in early April 1945, not long before Adolf Hitler had shoved a gun into his own (apparently halitosis-reeking) mouth. One young and eager girl from a broken Jewish home in Liverpool, wed to one man twelve years her senior from a sternly united if somewhat repressed Baptist family in Portsmouth. Wartime was certainly full of such improvised unions, in which probably both at first counted themselves fortunate, but I know for a fact that while my father never stopped considering himself lucky, my mother soon ceased to do so. She also decided, for a reason that I believe I can guess, to engage in the not-so-small deception of not mentioning to anyone in the Hitchens family that she was of Jewish descent.<br>&nbsp;<br>She herself had wanted to &#x201c;pass&#x201d; as English after noticing some slight unpleasantness being visited on my grandmother, who in the 1930s toiled in the millinery business. And Yvonne could pass, too, as a light brunette with hazel-ish eyes and (always to my fancy and imagination) a &#x201c;French&#x201d; aspect. But more to the point, I now feel sure, she did not want either me or my brother to be taxed with <i>die Judenfrage </i>&#x2014; the Jewish question. What I do not know is quite what this concealment or reticence cost her. What I can tell you something about is what it meant for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>The paradox was this: in postwar Britain as in Britain at all other times, there was only one tried and tested form of social mobility. The firstborn son (at least) had to be educated at a private school, with an eventual view to attending a decent university. But school fees were high, and the shoals of class and accent and social position somewhat difficult for first-timers to navigate. Neither of my parents had been to college. One of my earliest coherent memories is of sitting in my pajamas at the top of the stairs, eavesdropping on a domestic argument. It was an easy enough one to follow. Yvonne wanted me to go to a fee-paying school. My father &#x2014; &#x201c;The Commander&#x201d; as we sometimes ironically and affectionately called him &#x2014; made the heavy but obvious objection that it was well beyond our means. Yvonne was having none of this. &#x201c;If there is going to be an upper class in this country,&#x201d; she stated with decision, &#x201c;then Christopher is going to be in it.&#x201d; I may not have the words exactly right &#x2014; could she have said &#x201c;ruling class&#x201d; or &#x201c;Establishment,&#x201d; terms that would then have been opaque to me? &#x2014; but the purport was very clear. And, from my hidden seat in the gallery, I silently applauded. Thus a further paradox discloses itself: my mother was much less British than my father but wanted above all for me to be an English gentleman. (You, dear reader, be the judge of how well <i>that </i>worked out.) And, though she wanted to keep me near, she needed to argue hotly for my sake that I be sent away.<br>&nbsp;<br>I registered this contradiction very acutely as, alternating between the beams and smiles of maternal encouragement and the hot tears of separation, she escorted me to my boarding school at the age of eight. I shall always be slightly sorry that I didn&#x2019;t make more of an effort to pretend that I was desolated, too. I knew I would miss Yvonne but I suppose by then I&#x2019;d had the essential experience of being loved without ever being spoiled. I was eager to get on with it. And at the school, which I had already visited as a prospective boarder, there could be found a library with shelves that seemed inexhaustible. There was nothing like that at our house, and Yvonne had taught me to love books. The cruelest thing I ever did, at the end of my first term away from home, was to come home for Christmas and address her as &#x201c;Mrs. Hitchens.&#x201d; I shan&#x2019;t forget her shocked face. It was the enforced etiquette to address all females at the school, from masters&#x2019; wives to staff, in this way. But I still suspect myself of having committed a mean little attention-getting subterfuge.<br>&nbsp;<br>This perhaps helps explain the gradual diminution of my store of memory of Yvonne: from the ages of eight to eighteen I was to be away from home for most of the year and the crucial rites of passage, from the pains of sexual maturity to the acquisition of friends, enemies, and an education, took place outside the bonds of family. Nonetheless, I always somehow knew how she was, and could generally guess what I didn&#x2019;t know, or what was to be inferred from between the lines of her weekly letters.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father was a very good man and a worthy and honest and hardworking one, but he bored her, as did much of the remainder of her life. &#x201c;The one unforgivable sin,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;is to be boring.&#x201d; What she wanted was the metropolis, with cocktail parties and theater trips and smart friends and witty conversation, such as she had once had as a young thing in prewar Liverpool, where she&#x2019;d lived near Penny Lane and briefly known people like the madly gay Frank Hauser, later director of the Oxford Playhouse, and been introduced by a boyfriend to the work of the handsome Ulster poet Louis MacNeice, contemporary of Auden and author of <i>Autumn Journal </i>and (her favorite) <i>The Earth Compels </i>. What she got instead was provincial life in a succession of small English towns and villages, first as a Navy wife and then as the wife of a man who, &#x201c;let go&#x201d; by the Navy after a lifetime of service, worked for the rest of his days in bit-part jobs as an accountant or &#x201c;bursar.&#x201d; It is a terrible thing to feel sorry for one&#x2019;s mother or indeed father. And it&#x2019;s an additionally awful thing to feel this and to know the impotence of the adolescent to do anything at all about it. Worse still, perhaps, is the selfish consolation that it isn&#x2019;t really one&#x2019;s job to rear one&#x2019;s parents. Anyway, I knew that Yvonne felt that life was passing her by, and I knew that the money that could have given her the occasional glamorous holiday or trip to town was instead being spent (at her own insistence) on school fees for me and my brother, Peter (who had arrived during our time in Malta), so I resolved at least to work extremely hard and be worthy of the sacrifice.<br>&nbsp;<br>She didn&#x2019;t just sit there while I was away. She tried instead to become a force in the world of fashion. Perhaps answering the call of her milliner forebears, but at any rate determined not to succumb to the prevalent dowdiness of postwar Britain, she was forever involved in schemes for brightening the apparel of her friends and neighbors. &#x201c;One thing I <i>do </i>have,&#x201d; she used to say with a slightly defensive tone, as if she lacked some other qualities, &#x201c;is a bit of good taste.&#x201d; I personally thought she had the other qualities too: on those official holidays when parents would visit my boarding school and many boys almost expired in advance from the sheer dread of embarrassment, Yvonne never did, or wore, anything that I could later be teased about (and this was in the days when women still wore hats). She was invariably the prettiest and brightest of the mothers, and I could always kiss her gladly, right in front of everyone else, without any fear of mushiness, lipstick-stains, or other disasters. In those moments I would have dared anyone to tease me about her, and I was small for my age.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, the dress-shop business didn&#x2019;t go well. If it wasn&#x2019;t for bad luck, in fact, Yvonne would have had no luck at all. With various friends and partners she tried to float a store called Pandora&#x2019;s Box, I remember, and another called Susannah Munday, named for an ancestress of ours on the paternal Hampshire side. These enterprises just didn&#x2019;t fly, and I couldn&#x2019;t think why not except that the local housewives were just too drab and myopic and penny-pinching. I used to love the idea of dropping by as I went shopping, so that she could show me off to her friends and have a general shriek and gossip over some coffee, but I could always tell that business wasn&#x2019;t good. With what a jolt of recognition did I read, years later, V.S. Naipaul&#x2019;s uncanny diagnosis of the situation in <i>The Enigma of Arrival </i>. He was writing about Salisbury, which was close enough to Portsmouth:<br>&nbsp;<br>A shop might be just two or three minutes&#x2019; walk from the market square, but could be off the main shopping track. Many little businesses failed &#x2014; quickly, vi...</p><h2>What Color Is Your Underwear?</h2><p>Briefly speaking, this lift-the-flap book is laugh-out-loud fun, and educational, too!<br><br>This hilarious lift-the-flap features animals and the underwear they wear!

At Loaves and Fishes, each dish seems exactly as though it had been created in a regular home kitchen.<br><br>Now, with <b>Country Weekend Entertaining</b>, she shares her secrets so that home cooks, too, can soothe and pamper guests with simple, elegant, and delicious meals, from breakfast through dinner, all year long. In fact, instead of waiting for company, you can treat yourself and your family like guests and enjoy dishes such as Anna's Scrambled Eggs with Cream Cheese, Fresh Chives, and Popovers; her Grilled Veal Chops with Peach and Coriander Relish; and her Crumb-Topped Coffee Cake. Impressive enough for any formal event, every dish in this treasure trove of original recipes is nevertheless simple enough to prepare at whim, without waiting for a special occasion.<br><br>Arranged by season and illustrated with beautifully evocative color photographs, the more than 175 recipes in this book are certain to become the favorites of discerning home cooks everywhere.</p><p>Anna Pump grew up on a farm in Germany, near the Danish border, surrounded by a bounty of fresh vegetables, fruits, home-baked bread, and hand-churned butter. After moving to the U.S. in the 1980s, Pump established Loaves and Fishes, a catering and take-out shop in the seaside yet rural part of Long Island, New York, known as The Hamptons. She then opened a bed-and-breakfast called The Bridgehampton Inn in 1994. <p> Pump's cooking relies on excellent fresh ingredients in season, so her 175 recipes are grouped as Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter. Grilled Chicken Salad, succulent from breasts marinated with soy, sesame oil, and white wine; Potato and Corn Salad with unexpected fresh herbs; and Spinach Salad with Sliced Peaches are typical Spring/Summer dishes Pump offers. Reflecting Scandinavian influences in her cooking, dessert might bring the luxury of fresh currants and raspberries transformed into Red Grits with Cream. (Once made with barley meal, hence its name, corn or potato starch is now used to thicken this ruby jewel of a dish.)</p><p> Fridays, year round, Pump bakes a huge ham glazed with marmalade, apple cider, and mustard. Guests enjoy slices of it with their eggs at breakfast and in sandwiches later in the day. You may prefer it for dinner, accompanied by Pump's cauliflower, mashed and roasted with garlic and olive oil. Complete the meal with a Macadamia Nut Tart, cranberries studding its pecan pie-rich filling. Sixteen color photos and short poems and quotes praising the good life punctuate this book with charming thoughts. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Advance Praise for <b>Country Weekend Entertaining</b>:<p>"Every one of Anna's recipes is a showstopper!

There are 500 full-color photographs of beaded jewelry--necklaces, rings, bracelets, pins and earrings--created by 275 artists with beads, wire, filament, and fiber. Some of the artists are well-known to beaders, like Carol Wilcox Wells and Diane Fitzgerald, and some not-so-well-known, with their work published for the first time. This makes for a heady blend of inspiration, ideas, and expression. Editor Hemachandra selected the 500 beaded objects from submissions by 360 artists from 30 countries. To his credit, no single style-bead weaving, bead embroidery, bead stringing-gets short shrift. The photography is of high professional standards, no Instagram shots by amateurs posted to Facebook, and is also instructively illustrative of the beadwork, offering closeup shots that will help the aspiring bead worker reproduce some of the techniques.&#x201d; --<strong>Publishers Weekly</strong> <em></em>&nbsp; &#x201c;Author and juror Ray Hemachandra has undertaken the monumental task of putting together a collection of beadwork from bead artists all over the world and turned it into a tribute to the craft of fine beadwork, written in the voices of those whom it is actually meant to recognize.

Featured artists include Kasaburo Yoshida, Hiroshi Yoshida, Toshi Yoshida, Hodaka Yoshida, and the Yoshida women: Fujio, Chizuko, Kiso, and Ayomi, with approximately 20 oil paintings, 15 watercolors, and 100 woodblock prints, several sketchbooks, and other supporting photographs. These fine works are drawn from both public and private collections, most notably The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Toledo Museum of Art, Margaret and Eugene Skibbe (Minneapolis), the Tokyo National Museum, The Fukuoka Art Museum, and the Yoshida family. <p>The catalogue features essays by Koichi Yasunaga, chief curator at the Fukuoka Art Museum, Kendall Brown, professor at California State, Long Beach, Laura W. Allen of San Francisco, Eugene M. Skibbe of Minneapolis and Matthew Welch, curator of Japanese art at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. They provide new insights into each artist as well as a broad view of major issues confronting Japanese art in the late 19th and 20th century. The unique perspective of a single family also offers a rare opportunity to examine how family ties impact artistic creation.</p></p><p></p><h2>Blade of the Immortal, Vol. 1: Blood of a Thousand</h2><p>To end his eternal suffering, he must slay one thousand enemies! Manji, a ronin warrior of feudal Japan, has been cursed with immortality. To rid himself of this curse and end his life of misery, he must slay one thousand evil men! His quest begins when a young girl seeks his help in taking revenge on her parents&#39; killers . . . and his quest won&#39;t end until the blood of a thousand has spilled!</p><p><i>Blade of the Immortal</i> is a pure, unadulterated samurai epic told in a very moody black-and-white comic book. Artist Hiroaki Samura uses pencil drawings combined with pen-and-ink work to create this punk samurai feast. We don't know much about Manji except that he has been given the gift of immortality by an old witch in the form of the "blood worms." He makes a deal with her to end his immortality if he can kill 1,000 criminals. Soon everyone wants to hire him as an assassin, but it becomes increasingly difficult to tell who the real criminals are. Another interesting aspect of this book is the integrity of the "translation" of the art: because Japanese is read right to left and English is read left to right, most Japanese comics that are translated into English first have the art photo-reversed or mirror-imaged. Hiroaki Samura requested that this not be done. And so, for the most part, all of the panels were arranged in reverse order. Additionally, some of the dialogue and sound effects were left in their original Japanese calligraphy (with translations provided in caption boxes).</p><h2>Bel Canto</h2><p><p>Somewhere in South America, at the home of the country's vice president, a lavish birthday party is being held in honor of the powerful businessman Mr. Hosokawa. Roxanne Coss, opera's most revered soprano, has mesmerized the international guests with her singing. It is a perfect evening -- until a band of gunwielding terrorists takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different, a moment of great beauty, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people from different continents become compatriots, intimate friends, and lovers.</p></p><p>In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.<p> Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.</p><p> With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: </p><blockquote> Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. </blockquote> Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, <i>Bel Canto</i> remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i><p>Ann Patchett is the author of six novels and three works of nonfiction.

Lowie visited the Crow Indians at their reservation in Montana. He listened to tales that for many generations had been told around campfires in winter. Vivid tales of Old-Man-Coyote in his various guises; heroic accounts of Lodge-Boy and the Thunderbirds; supernatural stories about Raven-Face and the Spurned Lover; and other tales involving the Bear-Woman, the Offended Turtle, the Skeptical Husband--all these were recorded by Lowie. They were originally published in 1918 in an Anthropological Paper by the American Museum of Natural History. <p><i>Myths and Traditions of the Crow Indians</i> is now reprinted with a new introduction by Peter Nabokov.

But balance and harmony quickly give way to fear and confusion when respected tribal chairman Harvey Castle is found murdered at the powwow camp, and the evidence points to the chairman's nephew. Father John O'Malley, S.J., pastor of St. Francis Mission, and Vicky Holden, Arapaho attorney, do not believe that Anthony Castle - one of the most promising young people on the reservation - is capable of murder. Together they set out to find the real criminal and clear Anthony's name.<br>The trail that Father John and Vicky follow winds across the high plains of the Wind River Reservation into Arapaho homes and community centers and the fraud-infested world of Indian oil and land deals. Eventually it leads to the past - the Old Time - when the Arapahos were forced to leave their homes on the central plains and relocate on the reservation. It is through the horrendous crimes committed then that Father John and Vicky discover the motive for the murder of the tribal chairman a century later.

There is the intellectual genius of &#34;The Soul of Man under Socialism&#34;, in which he clearly foresaw the dangers of economic bureaucracy and state-worship: for Wilde, socialism meant liberation and individuality, not enslavement. Then there is the emotional genius of &#34;De Profundis&#34;, the long, introspective and often hostile letter he addressed to Lord Alfred Douglas from prison. And there is the poetical genius of &#34;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&#34;, in which Wilde&#39;s generous nature could movingly express for another&#39;s misery the sorrow he found it hard to express for his own. This collection contains, too, many examples of that humorous and epigrammic genius which captured the London theatre and which, by suddenly casting light from an unexpected angle, widened the bounds of truth.</p><p>Written from Wilde's prison cell at Reading Gaol to his friend and lover Lord Alfred Douglas, <i>De Profundis</i> explodes the conventions of the traditional love letter and offers a scathing indictment of Douglas's behavior, a mournful elegy for Wilde's own lost greatness, and an impassioned plea for reconciliation. At once a bracingly honest account of ruinous attachment and a profound meditation on human suffering, <i>De Profundis</i> is a classic of gay literature. Richard Ellmann calls <i>De Profundis</i> "a love letter...One of the greatest, and the longest, ever written." <br> <br> <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition contains newly commissioned notes."Displays the insight, honesty, and unself-conscious style of a great writer." <br>--W.

By proving that women had the skill, strength, and courage necessary to make this difficult and dangerous climb, the 1978 Women's Himalayan Expedition's accomplishment had a positive impact around the world, changing perceptions about women's abilities in sports and other arenas. Twenty years later, Arlene Blum has republished her account, offering her story to a new generation. Blum writes in the introduction, <blockquote>Annapurna has become for me a metaphor for difficult and important goals. Striving to achieve such objectives draws on all of our abilities and brings out the best in us. There are still many 'Annapurnas' to be climbed in the world--such as protecting our natural environment; decreasing the gap between rich and poor; providing basic necessities for everyone on this planet; and raising our children to live with love and good values.</blockquote> Impressive black-and-white photos record the women's journey from Katmandu to the summit and back again.

Her novels include <b>Lilian's Story</b> and <b>Albion's Story</b>, which was a finalist for the Miles Franklin Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for fiction.The fifth novel by Australian author Grenville (Lilian's Story, Joan Makes History) won Britain's prestigious Orange Prize last year and, at its best, it's easy to see why. It is an oddly uneven book, however, sometimes dazzlingly lyrical, compassionate and smart, but occasionally arch and rather clumsy. In the tiny backwater town of Karakarook, New South Wales, where everyone knows everyone else's business, two improbable outsiders fall very tentatively in love. Douglas Cheeseman is an engineer, sent to replace a historic bridge some townsfolk believe could be made into a tourist attraction. Museum curator Harley Savage has come from Sydney to create an exhibit of rural applied arts. The atmosphere of the town and the sunbaked, somnolent countryside is brilliantly rendered, and so, usually, are the prickly, deeply self-doubting lead characters; the use of a wonderfully observed dog as Harley's companion throughout is masterly. At other times, however, Grenville seems to be mocking her protagonists, as when Douglas is backed up to a fence by some cows, and the climactic scene, where he does something unwontedly brave, is forced. The subplot about a banker's self-regarding wife who allows herself to be seduced by a Chinese-born butcher is too coy by half. These elements are only disappointing because the book, when on target, is so remarkably clear-sighted about, yet fond of, its quirky characters. (Apr. 1)Forecast: The prize, noted on the cover, should certainly help to draw attention, and the book is readable and likable enough to earn good word of mouth. Admirers of Grenville's previous work are likely to be more critical.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Frequent Hearses</h2><p>Oxford don Gervase Fen is at the film studios to advise about a film biography of Alexander Pope, when he learns of Gloria&#39;s death.

They have two children.</p>Book Two of the Storyteller Trilogy (after Song of the River) continues Harrison's tale of intertribal warfare and its tragic consequences some 80 centuries ago in the stark and inhospitable land that is present-day Alaska. In the Near River Village, the Aleut healing woman K'os swears vengeance against Fox Barking, who had enslaved her after his brutal rape left her unable to bear children. Not even her adopted son, Chakliux the storyteller, is safe from her obsessive need to avenge her misery. Chakliux, of the Cousin River Village, has another problem as well. He loves beautiful Aqamdax, who is caught in a loveless marriage to the cruel Night Man. The love between Chakliux and Aqamdax and the dangers they face as they try to elude K'os form the central plot of this wide-ranging tale. Harrison's research is clearly reflected in her meticulous attention to details as disparate as the careful sewing of a parka and the rituals of a caribou hunt. Her characters are based on ancient Native American mythologies and storytelling traditions. But in her ambition to create a panoramic view of this long-gone culture, she offers an unwieldy cast of two-dimensional characters who live in indistinguishable villages and scurry about in myriad subplots that serve only to illustrate how much Harrison knows about her subject. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Domino Conspiracy</h2><p>While CIA agent Valentine and his partner, Sylvia, attempt to track down the would-be assassin of JFK, the KGB&#39;s Special Operations Group--Petrov, Talia, Ezdovo, Bailov, and Gnedin--protect Khrushchev. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Joseph Heywood is the author of The Snowfly, Covered Waters, The Berkut, Taxi Dancer, The Domino Conspiracy, the nine Grady Service Mysteries, Hard Ground: Woods Cop Stories, and the Lute Bapcat Mysteries Red Jacket and Mountains of the Misbegotten.

Visit the author at JosephHeywood.com.A dense and often plodding thriller--more cold-war espionage- -from the author of The Berkut (1987), etc. In early 1961, on the eve of the Vienna Summit in which new President Kennedy and Russian Premier Khrushchev will first take each other's measure, disaster looms. An elaborate plot by Russian conservatives is designed to bring about Khrushchev's downfall and death at the hands of Albanian assassins. A psychotic CIA agent with a murderous dual personality, frustrated because his personal plan to bring down the Albanian government has been thwarted, targets JFK for assassination. Both the US and Soviet governments are trying to piece together various clues about these situations. On the Soviet side is the Soviet Operations Group, first featured in The Berkut; leading the American effort is former CIA operative Beau Valentine, also from the earlier book. Heywood doesn't make it easy for the reader, what with quick cuts from scene to scene (no more than four pages at a stretch for the most part, often fewer), myriad new and recurring characters and relationships, and regular dead-end (emphasis on ``dead'') results to most investigative trails. All is leavened with generous dollops of hard sex and brutal violence. Much here to provoke serious thought--the manner in which a single piece of intelligence information can affect the course of history; how the Bay of Pigs fiasco might have colored Khrushchev's impression of JFK and US policy; etc.--but only a truly persevering reader will make the full journey down all the novel's labyrinthine pathways. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

While investigating unpleasant occurrences on a southern cattle-post, Mma Ramotswe, always on the side of the weak against the strong, has reason to reflect on Rule No.3 of The Principles of Private Detection: never lie to the client. Apprentice mechanic Charlie seems to be avoiding certain important responsibilities. And as Mma Makutsi&#39;s big day approaches, her nemesis Violet Sephotho is casting her net wider: by standing for election which could spell trouble for the entire nation. But as friends and family gather under starry African night skies, it turns out that even the most perplexing of apparitions - and the most shocking of crimes - may yield to rational explanation. And, of course, to Mma Ramotswe&#39;s inimitable way with love, intuition and redbush tea.</p><p>Following a distinguished career as a Professor of Medical Law, Alexander McCall Smith has turned to writing full-time. He is the author of over sixty books on a wide array of subjects, and his books have been translated into forty-five languages. He lives in Edinburgh with his wife.<p>CHAPTER ONE <br>&nbsp;<br>THE MEMORY OF LOST THINGS <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe had by no means forgotten her late white van. It was true that she did not brood upon it, as some people dwell on things of the past, but it still came to mind from time to time, often at unexpected moments. Memories of that which we have lost are curious things&#x2014;weeks, months, even years may pass without any recollection of them and then, quite suddenly, some�thing will remind us of a lost friend, or of a favourite possession that has been mislaid or destroyed, and then we will think: <i>Yes, that is what I had and I have no longer</i>. <br>&nbsp;<br>Her van had been her companion and friend for many years. Can a vehicle&#x2014;a collection of mechanical bits and pieces, nuts and bolts and parts the names of which one has not the faintest idea of&#x2014;can such a thing be a friend? Of course it can: physical objects can have personalities, at least in the eyes of their owners. To others, it may only be a van, but to the owner it may be the friend that has started loyally each morning&#x2014;except sometimes; that has sat patiently during long hours of waiting outside the houses of suspected adulterers; that has carried one home in the late afternoon, tired after a day&#x2019;s work at the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detec�tive Agency. And just like a person, a car or a van may have likes and dislikes. A good tar road is balm to man and machine and may pro�duce a humming sound of satisfaction in both car and driver; an unpaved road, concealing behind each bend a deep pothole or tiny mountain range of corrugations, may provoke rattles and groans of protest from even the most tolerant of vehicles. For this reason, the owners of cars may be forgiven for thinking that under the metal there lurks something not all that different from a human soul. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s van had served her well, and she loved it. Its life, though, had been a hard one. Not only had it been obliged to cope with dust, which, as anybody who lives in a dry country will know, can choke a vehicle to death, but its long-suffering suspen�sion had been required to deal with persistent overloading, at least on the driver&#x2019;s side. That, of course, was the side on which Mma Ramotswe sat, and she was, by her own admission and description, a traditionally built person. Such a person can wear down even the toughest suspension, and this is exactly what happened in the case of the tiny white van, which permanently listed to starboard as a result. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s husband, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, that excel�lent man, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and widely regarded as the best mechanic in all Botswana, had done his best to address the problem, but had tired of having to change the van&#x2019;s shock absorbers from side to side so as to equalise the strain. Yet it went further than that. The engine itself had started to make a sin�ister sound, which grew in volume until eventually the big-end failed. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am just a mechanic, Mma Ramotswe,&#x201d; he had said to his wife. &#x201c;A mechanic is a man who fixes cars and other vehicles. That is what a mechanic does.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe had listened politely, but her heart within her was a stone of fear. She knew that the fate of her van was at stake, and she would prefer not to know that. &#x201c;I think I understand what a mechanic does, Rra,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And you are a very good mechanic, quite capable of fixing a&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>She did not finish. The normally mild Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni had raised a finger. &#x201c;A mechanic, Mma,&#x201d; he pronounced, &#x201c;is different from a miracle-worker. A miracle-worker is a person who . . . works miracles. A mechanic cannot do that. And so when the time comes for a vehicle to die&#x2014;and they are mortal, Mma, I can assure you&#x2014; then he cannot wave a wand and make the car new again.&#x201d; He paused, looking at her with the air of a doctor imparting bad news. &#x201c;And so . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>He had done his best for her, of course, and bought her a spanking new van, blue this time, with an array of buttons on the dashboard that she had not yet dared investigate, and with an engine so quiet and unobtrusive that it was sometimes possible to believe that it was not switched on at all and that it was gravity alone, or some other mysterious force, that was propelling the van down the road. She tried to appear grateful, but it was hard. It was true that the point of a vehicle was to get you from one place to another without incident, but that, she thought, was not the only consideration. If efficiency were the only value in this life, then we would be content to eat bland but nutritious food every day&#x2014;and the same food at that. That would keep us alive, but it would make for very dull mealtimes. And the same was true of transport: there was all the world of difference between travelling along a highway in an air-conditioned bus, behind tinted glass, and making the same journey by a side-road, on a cart pulled by a team of mules, with the morning air fresh against your face and the branches of the acacia trees brushing past so close that you could reach out to touch the delicate green leaves. There was all that difference. <br>&nbsp;<br>The tiny white van had gone to a scrap dealer, and that, she thought, was the end. But then she encountered a woman who told her that a nephew of hers had acquired the van, and towed it up to his place near the Tuli Block. He loved tinkering, she said, and he might be able to do something with the parts that he could strip from the body of the van. That was all Mma Ramotswe heard, and nothing more. It was a better fate, perhaps, than that of total destruction in the jaws of some metal-crushing predator, but still she hoped that the young man who had bought the van for scrap might exercise his mechanical skills and restore it. And that possi�bility she kept in her mind, tucked away among the other scraps of hope of the sort that we go through life with, not thinking about them very much but unwilling to let them fade away altogether. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, on this crisp Botswana day, at the tail end of a winter that, for all its cold mornings, was still drenched in clear and constant sun, Mma Ramotswe was reminded of her former van by some�thing she saw on the road. She was driving past the Ministry of Water Affairs, her mind on a case that she had been working on for some time and was no nearer resolution than when she had started. She wondered whether she should not begin afresh, abandoning all the information she had obtained, and speaking to everybody again from scratch; possibly, she thought, it might be easier if . . . And then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw what seemed to be her tiny white van. It was not just that she saw a white van&#x2014;they were common enough in a country where the most popular colour for a vehicle was white&#x2014;it was the fact that the white vehicle she saw had the <i>air </i>of her van, a characteristic gait, so to speak, a way of moving. <br>&nbsp;<br>Her first instinct was to stop, and this she did, pulling in to the side of the road, her wheels throwing up a cloud of dust and causing the vehicle behind her to swerve angrily. She waved an apology&#x2014;that was not the sort of driving she condoned in others&#x2014; before twisting round in her seat to look at the turning down which she had glimpsed the van making its way. She saw nothing, so she decided to reverse a few yards to get a better view. But no, the side-road was empty. <br>&nbsp;<br>She frowned. Had she imagined it? She had read somewhere that those who mourn will sometimes see those they mourn&#x2014;or will think they see them. But she was not really mourning her van, even if she regretted its passing; she was not the sort of woman who would allow something like that to get in the way of living. She shook her head, as if to clear it, and then, on impulse, made a sweeping U-turn, heading off on to the side-road down which she had seen the white van disappear. <br>&nbsp;<br>A woman was sitting on a stone on the edge of the road, a small bundle of possessions on the ground beside her. Mma Ramotswe slowed down, and the woman looked at her enquiringly. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mma,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe through her open win�dow. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t stopped to give you a ride to wherever it is you want to go.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;I hoped you had, Mma, but I don&#x2019;t mind. My son promised to come and collect me, and he will get round to it eventually.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sometimes men forget these things,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;They tell us that they are too busy to do the things we want them to do, but they have plenty of time for their own concerns.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The woman laughed. &#x201c;Oh, that is right, my sister! I can hear them saying that in those voices that men have!&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe joined in the laughter. Then she asked, &#x201c;Did a white van come down this way, Mma? Not a big one&#x2014;a small one, same size as this one I&#x2019;m in but much older&#x2014;and white.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The woman frowned. &#x201c;When, Mma? I have only been sitting here for half an hour.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, not that long ago,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;About two or three minutes ago. Maybe four.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The woman shook her head. &#x201c;No, Mma. Nobody has been down here for at least ten minutes, maybe more. And there have been no white vans&#x2014;I would have seen one if there had been. I have been watching, you see.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are you sure, Mma?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The woman nodded vigorously. &#x201c;I am very sure, Mma. I see everything. I was in the police, you see. For three years, a long time ago, I was one of those police ladies. Then I fell off a truck and they said that I could not walk well enough to stay in. They are very fool�ish sometimes, and that is why the criminals sit there in those bars and tell one another stories of what the police have not done. They laugh at them and drink their beer. That is what is happening today, and God will certainly punish the politicians one day for letting this happen.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe smiled. &#x201c;You are right, Mma. Those criminals need to be taught a lesson. But to go back to the van, are you absolutely sure, Mma?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am one hundred per cent sure,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;If you made me stand up in the High Court in Lobatse and asked me whether I had seen a van, I would say certainly not and that is the truth.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe thanked her. &#x201c;I hope that your son comes soon, Mma,&#x201d; she said. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He will. When he has finished dancing with ladies or whatever he is doing, he will come.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe continued with her journey, completing the tasks she had been on her way to perform. She thought no more of the sighting of the van until she returned to the office a couple of hours later and mentioned the matter to Mma Makutsi. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I saw something very strange today, Mma,&#x201d; she began as she settled herself at her desk. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is no surprise,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi from the other side of the room. &#x201c;There are some very strange things happening in Gaborone these days.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe would normally have agreed with this&#x2014;there were very odd things happening&#x2014;but she did not want Mma Makutsi to get launched on the subject of politics or the behaviour of teenagers, or any of the other subjects on which she harboured strong and sometimes unconventional views. So she went on to describe the sighting of the van and the curiously unsettling con�versation she had had with the woman by the side of the road. &#x201c;She was very sure that there had been no van, Mma, and I believed her. And yet I am just as sure that I saw it. I was not dreaming.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi listened attentively. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You saw it, but she did not. What does that mean, Mma?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe considered this for a moment. There was something on the issue in Clovis Andersen&#x2019;s book, she seemed to remember; <i>The Principles of Private Detection </i>had a great deal to recommend it in all departments, but it was particularly strong on the subject of evidence and the recollection of what people see. <i>When two or more people see something, </i>the great authority had written, <i>you would be astonished at how many different versions of events you will get! This is not because people are lying; it is more because we see things differently. One person sees one thing, and another sees something altogether different. Both believe that they are telling the truth. </i><br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi did not wait for Mma Ramotswe to answer her question. &#x201c;It means that one of you saw something that the other did not.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe pondered this answer. It did not advance the matter very much, she thought. &#x201c;So the fact that one of you saw nothing,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi con�tinued, &#x201c;does not mean that there was nothing. She saw nothing because she did not notice anything. You saw something that she did not notice <i>because it was not there, </i>or it was not there in the way that you thought it was there.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I follow you, Mma Makutsi . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi drew herself up behind her desk. &#x201c;That van, Mma Ramotswe, was a ghost van. It was the spirit of a late van. That&#x2019;s what you must have seen.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe was not certain whether her assistant was being serious. Mma Makutsi could make peculiar remarks, but she had never before said anything quite as ridiculous as this. That was what made her feel that perhaps she was joking and that the proper reaction for her was to laugh. But if she laughed and her assistant was in fact being serious, then offence would be taken and this could be followed by a period of huffiness. So she confined her reaction to an innocent question: &#x201c;Do vans have ghosts, Mma? Do you think that likely?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why not,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;If people have ghosts, then why shouldn&#x2019;t other things have them? What makes us so special that only we can have ghosts? What makes us think that, Mma?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not so sure that there are ghosts of people anyway,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;If we go to heaven when we die, then who are these ghosts that people talk about? No, it doesn&#x2019;t seem likely to me.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi frowned. &#x201c;Ah, but who says that everybody goes to heaven?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;There are people who will not get any�where near heaven. I can think of many . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s curiosity was too much for her. &#x201c;Such as, Mma?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi showed no hesitation in replying. &#x201c;Violet Sepho�tho,&#x201d; she said quickly. &#x201c;There will be no place for her in heaven&#x2014; that is well known. So she will have to stay down here in Gaborone, walking around and not being seen by anybody because she will be a ghost.&#x201d; She paused, an expression of delight crossing her face. &#x201c;And, Mma, she will be a ghost in high-heeled shoes! Can you imagine that, Mma? A ghost tottering around on those silly high heels that she wears. It is a very funny thought, Mma. Even those who saw such a ghost would not be frightened but would burst out laughing. Other ghosts would laugh, Mma&#x2014;they would, although we wouldn&#x2019;t hear them, of course.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Unless we were ghosts ourselves by that stage,&#x201d; interjected Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;Then we would hear them.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>This warning made Mma Makutsi fall silent. It had been an appetising picture that she had been painting, and she slightly resented Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s spoiling it like this.

This insightful biography shows how Grant worked side-by-side with figures such as Theodore Roosevelt to found the Bronx Zoo, preserve the California redwoods, and save the American bison from extinction. But Grant was also the leader of the eugenics movement in the United States. He popularized the infamous notions that the blond-haired, blue-eyed Nordics were the &#x201c;master race&#x201d; and that the state should eliminate members of inferior races who were of no value to the community. Grant&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes machina�tions convinced Congress to enact the immigration restriction legis�lation of the 1920s, and his influence led many states to ban interracial marriage and sterilize thousands of &#x201c;unworthy&#x201d; citizens. Although most of the relevant archival materials on Madison Grant have mysteriously disappeared over the decades, Jonathan Spiro has devoted many years to reconstructing the hitherto concealed events of Grant&#x2019;s life. His astonishing feat of detective work re�veals how the founder of the Bronx Zoo wound up writing the book that Adolf Hitler declared was his &#x201c;bible.&#x201d;</p><p>JONATHAN SPIRO is a professor of history at Castleton State College in Vermont.Spiro's unfortunately-titled new book is a comprehensive examination of a powerful but nearly forgotten American figure, Madison Grant. A chief proponent of conservation, Grant spearheaded the creation of several national parks but also, as one of the most fervent proponents of science-based racism, introduced the world to the concept of the "master race." Grant's theories had an immeasurable effect on the turn-of-the-century world; a patrician academic who never held elected office, Grant nevertheless became a close confidante to several presidents, helping shape national policy on issues including conservation to immigration. Spiro also explores the complex history of the international eugenics movement and how it influenced organizations from the Nazi party to Planned Parenthood. Spiro's text is organized by theme, sacrificing clear chronology for a better grasp of Grant's pervasive influence-a worthwhile trade that keeps the narrative comprehensive and enlightening, peeling back layers of history to expose America's casual racism and the disturbing ways American law set the precedent for Nazi atrocities. A superb re-introduction to one of America's most complex modern figures, Spiro's account can only be faulted for a tendency to dig too deeply, occasionally stalling in minutiae. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In our own day, Monticello has been added to the United Nation' list of World Heritage Sites that must be protected at all costs, designating the house and grounds as an international treasure.</p><p> <i>Thomas Jefferson's Monticello</i> is a collection of essays and color photography showcasing this extraordinary American home. Featuring essays written by scholars at Monticello, chapters focus on all aspects of the house and plantation. Monticello, a model of elegance and symmetry, was designed by Jefferson himself, whose architectural prowess prompted a visitor in 1782 to note: "Mr. Jefferson is the first American who has consulted the Fine Arts to know how he should shelter himself from the weather." Inside, Jefferson assembled a world-class collection of objects and furnishings: art and porcelain from France, scientific instruments from England, the finest American furniture from Philadelphia and New York, natural artifacts brought back from the West, as well as furnishings made in Monticello's own joinery by enslaved craftsmen. Surrounding the house, Monticello's celebrated gardens and grounds form an experimental yet breathtakingly lovely landscape of flowers, fruits, and vegetables from the Old and New Worlds. A final chapter on the plantation and the enslaved community at Monticello provides a context in which to place and understand the house and its owner.</p><p>With an introductory essay by Wendell Garrett, this compilation is a comprehensive, long-awaited study of Thomas Jefferson's "little mountain."</p></p><p>William L.

He maintained a public image of blistering intelligence, savage wit, and belligerent fierceness of opinion until his death in 1995. In his letters, he confirms the legendary aspects of his reputation, and much more. This collection contains more than eight hundred letters that divulge the secrets of the artist and the man, with an honesty and immediacy rare in any biography or memoir.<p>Amis, so assured in his pronouncements on fellow writers, grapples privately with fears, self-doubts, ambitions, and personal disasters. He is wildly funny, indulging in mordant gossip and astonishing frankness with his intimate friends and lovers. Some letters are dashed off with signature frustration; others are written with painstaking and painful circumspection. They make vivid the triumphs and tumult of his life and his times, from post-war Britain through the Thatcher era, as well as his attractions to women, jazz, drink, and the comic possibilities of the English language.</p><p>As an intellectual pugilist who took no prisoners, Kingsley Amis had few peers. These letters, at times scandalous, at times tragic, reinforce his historical relevance and literary stature.</p></p><p>KINGSLEY AMIS was born in London in 1922. From his fictional debut with Lucky Jim to his death in 1995, he published twenty-five novels and numerous works of non-fiction, verse, volumes of short stories, and anthologies of poetry and prose. He was also a prolific critic and polemicist in newspapers and magazines. He was knighted in 1990. ZACHARY LEADER is professor of English literature at the University of Surrey Roehampton.

Christians today, as in the first century, can draw strength and courage from John&#39;s telling of the story of Jesus, a telling that consistently reflects not only the words and deeds of Jesus but their inner significance. We are called to worship as we find the Father, Son and Spirit revealed in the Gospel. And as in Jesus we discover God&#39;s light, life and love, we learn to respond in faith, humility and obedience. In this engaging, pastorally-oriented commentary, readers will find an introduction with background material concerning authorship, date and purpose, as well as a summary of important theological themes. A passage-by-passage exposition follows that focuses on understanding what John had to say to his original readers in order to see its relevance for the church today. Students, pastors, Bible teachers and everyone who wants to understand the message of John for the church will benefit from this excellent resource.</p><p>Rodney A.

More than poisonous rivalries among sisters-in-law, destructive secrets, and the implosion of the family business, this is a family unravelling as the society around it fractures. For this is a moment of turbulence, of inevitable and unstoppable change: the chasm between the generations, and between those who have and those who have not, has never been wider. Ambitious, rich, humane and striking, The Lives of Others unfolds a family history, and anatomises a social class in all its contradictions. It asks: can we escape what is in our blood?

Deliverance was originally part of every church, but the rise of self-help programs and the idea of an individual&#39;s ability to change without God&#39;s help edged the Church away from God&#39;s Word and power.

He lectures and conducts workshops around the world for such organizations as the PGA and the LPGA and for major corporations, including Apple Computer, Oracle, and Pfizer.Flouting course etiquette, Shoemaker recommends throwing golf clubs. Golfers who have just dunked a ball in their local water hazard might thank him for the permission, but Shoemaker's point--his only mechanical tip--is not to release anger but to restore the relaxation flowing from a confident swing. Since that feeling rarely returns by tinkering with technique, Shoemaker and his coauthor, brother Pete, stress attitude, much in the manner of Michael Murphy's classic <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i>. (Shoemaker, like Murphy before him, teaches inspirational golf at the Esalen Institute.) Once a legitimate aspirant to the PGA tour, Shoemaker soured on the sport, only to realize much later that his problem was worrying how he looked, rather than playing each shot in the moment. Since getting in that zone obsesses every golfer, Shoemaker's pep talk is sure to find an audience, especially among those who like to mix golf with New Age philosophy. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Mother Teresa: In the Shadow of Our Lady</h2><p>Used.

By standing close to Our Lady we can find the grace and courage to overcome our own personal trials and crosses. Summon the same powerful presence and aid of Our Lady by following the example of Mother Teresa. From dawn to dusk, decade to decade, Mother Teresa's life had been spent, in every sense of the word, in the shadow of Our Lady. Our Lady helps us, as Mother Teresa found in her vision, to become contemplatives at the foot of the cross--to discover God's presence and love, even in the midst of our trials and dark nights. Nothing was impossible for Mother Teresa while she clung to Our Lady, and as Mother Teresa tells us, "nothing is impossible for all who call Mary mother." </p><p> "Sitting with Mother Teresa, watching her tend to the sick and the dying, feeling the aura of holiness around her person, seeing her bent in prayer, lost in God--how often I asked myself if I was not seeing something of Our Lady, experiencing a glimpse of the Virgin of Nazareth" &#x2013;-Author and co-founder of Mother Teresa's priests' community, Joseph Langford, MC </p><p> Joseph Langford, MC began his long association with Mother Teresa while studying theology in Rome.

He resides at the community's mother house in Tijuana, Mexico.<br><b>Amazon.com Exclusive</b><br><br>I remember Mother Teresa's passing as if it was yesterday. The crowds of Calcutta's grieving poor, pressing ahead, with tributes of stray flowers clutched to their hearts, hoping to get a glimpse of their saint, as she lie in state in St. Thomas' Church. The media everywhere; snapping photos, lining up interviews, and hefting video cameras from place to place in the drenching heat. A who's-Who of the U.N. lining up to lay garlands before the bier at her state funeral. And finally, closed away from the crowds and cameras, the family she founded huddled around her grave, as we lowered her into the vault, and cast handfuls of sand from a plastic bucket onto her casket as she disappeared from view for the last time. </p><p> In the days surrounding her funeral, those who had known Mother Teresa closely mingled with those who had known her only from afar; sharing their common sorrow, but also their stories. Stories of meeting Mother Teresa for the first time; things she said and did; how she had touched them and marked their lives. Among the reminiscences were the kudos of gratitude you would expect to hear, there was one that took me aback--not out of disagreement, but out of wonder that these simple people, many of whom did not share her faith, could have been so perceptive. Time and again they remarked that Mother Teresa had reminded them of Mary, the mother of Jesus; that they had felt a presence, some special anointing of tenderness and goodness, that brought to mind the Virgin of Nazareth. They didn&#x2019;t understand how or why, but they knew they felt it, and they were still touched by it. </p><p> For those who had known Mother Teresa well, this would only confirm what they knew, what they had long observed in her and admired--a deep and even intimate relationship with Mary, solid not sentimental, lived in the realm of spirit but without fanfare, in the midst of the simplest daily duties, as she bathed the dying and fed the hungry. Things that surely the mother of Christ would have done right along side her. </p><p> The heights of the spirit, scaled from the bottom of a teacup, from the wound of a leper, from a plate of rice. This was the legacy Mother Teresa received from Mary, and was formed in, living day after day in this hidden school of God's goodness going on between the two of them in her heart. With this little volume, In the Shadow of Our Lady, I wanted to share some of that hidden intimacy with a larger public&#x2014;and not just as a way of understanding the courage and commitment she showed at standing at today&#x2019;s Calvaries, as did Mary, but as an invitation and a primer for the reader to share in that gift Jesus left us in saying, "<i>Disciple, Behold your Mother.</i>"</p><p> <i>--Joseph Langford, MC, co-founder of Mother Teresa's priestly order</i></p><p>"Stay very close to Our Lady.

He is provost of Brown University and professor of anthropology and Italian studies.<br>Augusto Barbieri couldn&#x2019;t imagine what would have brought in the woman who sat across the desk from him. He had opened his office in Bologna only a few years earlier, in 1886, and at twenty-eight had little experience with clients of any kind. Yet he knew that a visitor like this one was unusual. If he felt a bit taken aback by the roughly dressed woman, she must have viewed him with even greater discomfort. Although he was not wealthy, the young lawyer took pride in the way he looked and in having his office reflect the importance of his social position. He wore a dark, three- piece woolen suit. Ponderous law books stood neatly in glass-paned wooden cabinets behind his heavy antique desk. Yet, although the woman came from another world, it was a world he knew something about. From her dress and the way she walked, anyone could tell that she was a peasant. And because he himself had come from the mountains outside Bologna and moved to the city as a child, he had no trouble identifying her distinctive dialect. Should he ask her to sign her name, he knew, she would simply blush and shake her head. That is, she would have blushed if she were not already so red, for her face was covered by a rash. And though he expected her to feel ill at ease in the unfamiliar surroundings, she seemed exceptionally uncomfortable in the open-backed wood chair. While having an illiterate peasant woman in his office came as a surprise to him, it was not unwelcome. The young lawyer had built his reputation, at least among his small circle of colleagues, as part of a band of an enlightened elite whose mission was to transform Italy into a modern country. For too long, they thought, the Italian peninsula had been in the control of reactionary forces the church most of all, but also an assortment of retrograde aristocrats. Ever since Napoleon&#x2019;s troops had brought the ideas of the Enlightenment to Italy at the turn of the nineteenth century, there were those who dreamed of a day when the old regimes would be swept away and Italy unified under secular rule. This movement the Risorgimento culminated in the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, when the old order crumbled and the power of the church was dealt a severe blow. By the time Amalia entered Barbieri&#x2019;s office, the offspring of Italy&#x2019;s Risorgimento had divided into two broad political camps: the right and the left. Both were considered anathema by the church, which refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new state and called on good Catholics to boycott it. That portion of the old aristocracy who saw change as desirable, or at least inevitable, naturally congregated on the right, along with other large landowners. The left, to which Barbieri belonged, brought together a wide range of groups, from those who rejected the Savoyard monarchy and demanded a republic to those who had made peace with the monarchy but believed not in the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, but in a new god, the god of science. It was to this moderate camp that Barbieri belonged. Life could be improved for everyone, he and his colleagues believed, and they saw it as their mission to better the lot of society&#x2019;s unfortunates. The educated elite had a duty, they thought, to do away with the vestiges of medieval society and with the power of those who had profited from it: the church and the aristocracy. Two years earlier, Barbieri had published a weighty tome on the proper use of government: to improve the public good. He devoted much of it to problems of public education, public health, and protecting the working class, railing against the evils of class privilege and calling for a society where people gained rewards based only on their merits. The new science of social statistics would help reveal society&#x2019;s ills, he believed, and the application of scientific methods would show them what needed to be done. Old institutions would have to embrace these new principles or be replaced. The woman who faced him certainly seemed to embody the social ills he had written about, an impression that only grew when he heard the story she was about to tell. Barbieri wondered how she had chosen him from all of the city&#x2019;s lawyers. There were likely no attorneys where she came from, and, he could safely assume, of the world of the law and the courts she knew nothing. But, as he was to learn on that day in early August 1890, she had recently experienced such a traumatic turn of events that it seemed to her that she was scarcely the same person she had been just a few months earlier. It took her a long time to tell her story, but Barbieri could be a good listener and was more than willing to put off the little work he had to hear whhat she had to say.<br><br>Her name, she said, was Amalia Bagnacavalli. She lived in a little hamlet called Oreglia, part of the larger mooooountain town of Vergato, whose hamlets lay scattered across a vast area. With her lived her husband, Luigi, their one- year-old daughter, and Luigi&#x2019;s family. Amalia&#x2019;s marriage had meant a step down for her: while her parents owned the land they farmed, her husband&#x2019;s family had no land of their own. These distinctions meant something to the people of the mountains, even though life was difficult for them all, for the soil was rocky, the growing season short, the parcels the peasants owned small. Winters were the hardest time. Supplies put in storage the previous fall dwindled, and the new crops were still far off. That winter, just as their stocks sank to their lowest point of the year, Luigi&#x2019;s parents urged Amalia to help out in a way that she had never been able to before. All the families they knew looked to the foundling home in Bologna in times of need. In exchange for taking in foundlings, they received monthly payments that for many provided the only cash they had. Most generous of all were the payments made to the women who could nurse the newly abandoned babies. The foundling home would not allow a woman with a child under age one and so nursing her own child to take a foundling to nurse. But Amalia&#x2019;s baby, Adele, had just passed her first birthday. Amalia had never traveled outside the Oreglia area and had never seen a town of more than a few hundred people. To get a foundling meant going to Bologna, twenty miles away and separated by a road that this time of year was often impassable. Blocked by snow in the coldest months, the road snaked along the Reno River, whose swollen waters regularly flooded it in the spring. Fortunately, three years before Amalia&#x2019;s birth, the train line running south from Bologna to Tuscany opened to great fanfare. She had often seen trains pass but had never been on one herself, or for that matter ever traveled anywhere except by foot or, on rare occasions, in a wagon or on a mule. That March morning she walked to the tiny station a few kilometers from her home and gave the stationmaster five lire for a ticket to Bologna. Handling the coins was itself a new experience, and, as Barbieri knew, the money seemed like a sizable sum to her. Even if she had been lucky enough to be hired for a week to do farm labor, she would barely have been paid that much. Her mother-in-law had given Amalia the money for the one-way fare, telling her that the foundling home would pay for her return. That Amalia would travel by herself, without her husband, was not surprising, for her trip to the foundling home was firmly part of a world of women&#x2019;s affairs that had existed for centuries. Although peasant life in northern Italy was in some ways patriarchal, there was a sharp separation between the spheres of men and women. In the women&#x2019;s sphere, women ruled. For a young woman like Amalia, it was Luigi&#x2019;s mother, her own mother- in-law, who controlled her daily life. Luigi himself would keep his distance from any affairs involving infants although, as it would turn out, he would soon be involved in dealings with the foundling home that he could never have anticipated. When Amalia got off the train in Bologna, she could only have gawked at the massive city wall in front of her. Built in the 1300s to defend Bologna from its medieval enemies, it was a towering sign of the boundary separating the world of the peasants from the world of civilization. Amalia spotted the towering gate that would allow her to pass into the city. As she approached it, she encountered the two officials who always stood watch there, one who wore a normal suit and hat and the other a police uniform, a sheathed sword hanging from his waist. The men stood guard, eyeing peasants such as Amalia with particular care, looking for signs of a telltale bulge in their clothes. They knew all the tricks that the peasant women used to sneak in goods for the market in their billowing blouses. Had they suspected something, they would have ushered Amalia into a nearby booth, where a female guard would have had her disrobe. The wall no longer served any purpose militarily, but it still proved valuable to the city fathers. No one could bring goods in without paying a tax, a medieval practice that had somehow survived in the modern Italian state and which even then provided the city with the bulk of its annual budget. For the peasants outside, seeking to sell their fruits and vegetables in the city, nighttime offered a chance to try to scale the wall in those vulnerable spots where an athletic young man might have a chance. Other peasants built secret compartments in their donkey-drawn carts, hoping to avoid the duty on at least some of their goods. Amalia, carrying no basket, her clothes showing no evidence of forbidden fruits, would not have been stopped. Having no clear idea of where to go, she must have asked a woman nearby for directions. At that time of year, Bologna&#x2019;s popolane women from the poorer classes that dominated the city&#x2019;s population typically wore heavy dark coats over smocks that went all the way down to their sturdy shoes. These women covered their heads with a simple kerchief (if they covered them at all), for hats were for women of greater means. A poor woman wearing a hat would be ridiculed for her pretensions. Along the side of the medieval canal that ran through the city, a sickening smell wafting from its dark, sewage-laced waters, dozens of women lined up shoulder to shoulder. Oblivious to the rest of the world, they dunked their bed linens and underwear in the murky water and then beat them on the brick shelf that lined the canal. All along the canal crude wooden stakes were sunk into the ground, a rope running between them. The white sheets that the women hung to dry from the ropes stood out against the dark buildings behind them. When she returned to the city a few months later to meet Barbieri for the first time, Amalia would see these same women in a slightly different position. Beneath the spot where they had stood before was a second, submerged shelf, which made their work easier in the warmer months although, as Barbieri knew, it put them at increased risk of infection from the many diseases carried by the putrid waters. Men passed by in small donkey-pulled carriages, sitting on the wooden slat-backed bench that stretched between the two large wooden wheels, most wearing dark capes draped over their shoulders and round black hats with wide, flat brims. Even the poor took pride in how they looked. A man would rather appear every day in his one good, clean suit, although it had been patched dozens of times, than wear one marked by a single stain. Beneath the porticoes over the city&#x2019;s sidewalks gathered people who were clearly of another class altogether. Some men wore suits with vests and high- collared white shirts, their dapper look completed with bowler hats. The women of the more comfortable classes paid even more attention to their appearance, dressing in elaborate, light-colored suits and huge hats, often with a smartly tied silk kerchief around their neck and an umbrella hooked on arm. Their formfitting clothes, hugging their bodies from their chests all the way down their legs, stood in sharp contrast to the loose dress of the poor. Those who could do so tried to leave their homes during the day, for the great majority of Bologna&#x2019;s hundred thousand residents lived in dark, dank apartments. Filled with smoke from the charcoal braziers that warmed them, they were rank from the stench of the sewage and night water. It was March, and the popolani had made their way once again through the winter, which they called the onion months,&#x201d; in rueful reference to the cheap, easily preserved ingredient that flavored the polenta that was all they had to fill their stomachs. They were damp months, the fog often so thick that it was impossible to see across the street, months when work was short, the nights were long, and those families that had enough charcoal to heat their homes were considered lucky. But what must have struck Amalia was not this poverty but the magnificence of what she saw around her. She had never seen buildings as splendid as the massive, ornate stone structures that lined the road and never seen porticoes like the ones she walked under. She could not have passed through the city gate without seeing something she had never encountered before, a steam trolley, which had begun service in Bologna seven years earlier, its route circling the walls. Inside the city, an endless procession of horsedrawn carriages rumbled down the streets, each with an umbrella fixed to the front seat to protect its driver from Bologna&#x2019;s frequent rain. Running down the middle of the cobblestone street that led from the city gate toward the main piazza, open-sided trolleys raced by, each pulled along its steel track by two horses. At nearly every corner, a woman would sit on a stoop before a blackened brazier, the heat visible as waves and smoke, with a pile of thick chestnut pancakes to sell to hungry passersby. Men and women carrying large wicker baskets sold an assortment of other treats. One such man, a well-known figure in Bologna, wearing a tall top hat and carrying an outsized basket, attracted more attention than the rest, not only because his sugared focacce were a powerful lure for the hungry, but because he was famous for regaling all who would listen with stories of his friendship with the queen. If Amalia noticed a special excitement in the air, it was not just people&#x2019;s relief at making it through another winter. Something stupendous was coming to Bologna, and people could talk of nothing else. Every wall, it seemed, was plastered with large, colorful posters announcing the imminent arrival of Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West show, which would play for eight days to standing-room crowds. Europe had been abuzz with reports of Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s extravaganza ever since his first visit to England, three years earlier. It was hard to forget the image of the show&#x2019;s command performance for Jubilee Day, when the kings of Denmark, Greece, and Belgium crowded into a small stagecoach next to the Prince of Wales and future king of England with Buffalo Bill at the reins, fending off a mock attack from a threatening band of whooping, feathered Indians. Buffalo Bill had returned to Europe in 1889, bound first for the Paris Universal Exposition, where over ten thousand people, including the French president, crowded into the show&#x2019;s opening performance. From there the show made its way to southern France and Spain before heading for Rome, where the cowboy entrepreneur was received by the elderly Pope Leo XIII. Buffalo Bill Cody, an iconic figure in his buckskin suit on his white horse, was now coming to Bologna with scores of Indians; well over a hundred horses on which they performed their savage, bare-chested acts of derring-do; a dozen buffalo; a handful of elk and Texas steer; and the famed twenty-nine-year-old sharpshooter Annie Oakley. Those lucky enough to see the show were in for another special treat.

Nine miners were below when water trapped in an adjacent mine burst through the wall of the new mine they were working. As the air grew thinner and the men grew colder, they listened to the water rising around them in the honeycomb of coal veins. Sitting in a small air pocket, the men wrote farewell notes to their families and sealed them in a lunch bucket.<p>On the surface, the rescue effort became hampered when a special drill bit snapped. The drill would lay idle for 14 hours, effectively halting the rescue, as a replacement was brought in. Hope and despondency alternated, as the determined rescue team made progress, then hit setbacks. Below ground, standing in water and chilling temperatures, the men rode the same waves of hope and despair, all in complete darkness.</p><p>The successful rescue of the <em>Nine for Nine</em> miners lifted the spirits of an entire nation. Now everyone can hear the complete story of this harrowing accident -- how these men and their families had the strength and bravery it took to survive the incredible ordeal, and of the frantic efforts to save them.</p></p><p><b>Jeff Goodell</b> has been a staff writer at <i>Rolling Stone</i> and a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. His stories have appeared in many anthologies, including <i>Best Business Stories of the Year 2001</i>, and his commentary can often be heard on NPR&#x2019;s <i>All Things Considered</i>. His first book, <i>The Cyberthief and the Samurai</i>, was about the hunt for notorious computer hacker Kevin Mitnick. His memoir, <i>Sunnyvale: The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and was picked as one of the ten best books of 2000 by critic Walter Kirn. He lives near Saratoga Springs, New York, with his wife and two kids.The story of the nine Pennsylvania coal miners who were trapped underground for more than three days last July could have easily been sidetracked by aphorisms about America's post-September 11 can-do spirit and the like. But since this tale is mainly told via the miners' own words, it's a blessedly unsentimental and true-to-life account of a horrifying situation and a triumphant escape. Goodell (The Cyberthief and the Samurai: The True Story of Kevin Mitnick-And the Man Who Hunted Him Down) proves a knowing scribe for this story of adventure and endurance, alternating between filling in the setting when necessary and just letting the miners talk, oral history style. For example, one miner, John Unger, recalls, "To keep our spirits up, we talked about what we were going to do when we got out.... Nobody had anything extravagant in mind. Harpo was going to have a cigarette and a beer and a chew." Goodell then adds, "At about 2:30 p.m., Yost's drill finally reached a depth of about 230 feet, roughly 15 feet above the floor of the mine." It's a pulse-racing tale, in which a drill punches into an old, abandoned, water-filled mine, quickly flooding the space where the miners are working, trapping them in a dark, cold pocket of rapidly diminishing air. Goodell wisely keeps the focus on these hard-bitten men and the bravery that kept them going through those long, indistinguishable days and nights underground.

The writing is sharp and to the point, and though there's plenty of silly stuff ("Who are the Black Muppets?"; the "hidden hate" in Wite Out and watermelon seeds), the underlying message is dead serious: racism pervades every aspect of culture, from travel books to television. Anyone who can call himself Chairman Mao must have a very thick coat of irony to protect himself-as should prospective readers, some of whom will remember ego trip's Book of Rap Lists, "hip hop's answer to the telephone book, you pity-party patsies." 3-color illus. throughout. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Native American Portraits</h2><p>Over one hundred photographs from the renowned Kurt Koegler collection of Native American portraits taken between the end of the Civil War and the end of World War I are featured in this powerful compendium depicting a proud and defeated people. <i>Native American Portraits</i> presents a factual, anecdotal, and visual history of the evolving artistry and technology of a century of photographers, as well as of the tribes whose vanishing trappings and traditions they sought to capture with their craft. The photographers -- William Henry Jackson, Camillus Fly, Carleton Watkins, and Lee Moorhouse, among scores of others -- were intrepid adventurers, fiercely committed to their work, who hauled hundreds of pounds of photographic equipment across the mountains and faced many dangers; their subjects -- including such important warriors as Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce, Red Cloud, Geronimo, and Chief Gall (who led the Indians to victory against Custer) -- appear venerable, dignified, and beaten. Fascinating and provocative, this richly illustrated and painstakingly annotated volume documents the intersection of photography in its infancy and Native American culture in precipitous decline.</p><p>Nancy Hathaway is the author of The Unicorn, as well as many articles on photography, art, psychology, and other topics for a variety of magazines, including Harper&#39;s Bazaar, New Woman, American Way, and the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. She lives in Venice, California.This volume of over 100 duotone photographs from the noted Kurt Koegler collection documents both the development of photography as an art and the history of a proud but defeated people. Early photographers like Alexander Gardner and William Henry dragged their equipment across mountains and deserts to photograph often hostile and suspicious subjects. With the closing of the frontier and the establishment of the reservations, the photographic style changed from a straightforward realism to the romantic image of the noble Indian. As Hathaway admits in her introductory essay, many of the pictures suffer from a lack of information about the Indians and the photographers, but the haunting images of warriors, medicine men, and families from many tribes make this a valuable addition to photography and Native American collections.<br><i>- Wilda Williams, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Second Chance</h2><p>The daughter of a prominent psychiatrist disappears and Harry Stoner, involved in a most heart-wrenching case, discovers that the young woman&#39;s secrets and one past violent act could tear lives-- and hearts--apart.

It represents five years of weekends spent walking the countryside (some 5,000 miles), swimming through flooded caverns, staying out all night on islands, sifting fossil bones, and exploring cattle-tramped tombs. The book crackles with the excitement and perplexity aroused by Ireland&#39;s heritage of tombs and ring forts. The Introduction by Michael Viney (author of A Year&#39;s Turning; Dufour Editions) puts the book in context and relates it to today&#39;s concerns over conservation and ecology.</p><p>Robert Lloyd Praeger, born in County Down in 1865, was educated at Queen&#39;s College Belfast. He worked at the National Library for over thirty years and was Librarian from 1920 to 1924 and later President of the Royal Irish Academy 1931 - 1934. Best known as a botanist, his earliest researches were on geology and archaeology. His books include Natural History of Ireland, A Populous Solitude and Some Irish Naturalists. He died in 1953.Praeger was one of Ireland's premier botanists. With this volume, released in 1937, the author offers his observations on not only the Emerald Isle's flora but also its animal life, geology, archaeology, and more. Reproduced to mark the 60th anniversary of its original publication, this edition includes a new introduction that puts the book in context to contemporary issues.

As an infant I had been, I heard, somewhat frail and puny, and with the unlucky blemish that caused me to be scorned by some and feared by others. My foster-mother, Hannah Wellcome, having at that period several boys in her care greater in size than myself, and fearful that, among them, I might receive some fatal injury (thus depriving her of my foster-fee) daily dispatched me with a halfpenny, from the time that I could walk, to the vicarage and the decidedly questionable custody of the parson, Dr Moultrie. With the halfpenny I bought three cakes at the village baker's for my dinner; and Dr Moultrie, to keep me from plaguing him with questions, for he was a slothful old party given to drowsing away many of the daylight hours in his chair, lost no time in teaching me to read, and turning me loose in his library. There, having run through such tales of Tom Hickathrift, Jack the Giant-Killer and Gold-Locks as remained from the days of his own children (long since grown and gone), I was obliged to munch on more solid fare, Goldsmith's History of England, volumes of the Spectator, the plays of Shakespeare, and much poetry and theology, besides Berquin's Ami des Enfants and some simple Italian tales (in consequence of which I acquired a readiness and taste for learning foreign tongues that has later stood me in good stead).<br><br>There was one volume that I read over and over, The Death of Arthur it was called, and I found the tales in it of knights and battles, Sir Beaumain, Sir Persaint, Merlin the enchanter and King Arthur himself, most haunting; they held sway over my mind for weeks together. But alas! one day, absorbed in the tale of the death of King Hermance, I dropped a great blob of jam from the tart I was eating on to the page of the book. When Dr Moultrie discovered this, he gave me a terrible beating, after which I could hardly crawl home, and he locked the book away; I never laid eyes on it again.<br><br>However, to his credit, it must be said that finding me an eager pupil Dr Moultrie was prepared to emerge from his torpor for an hour or two each day to instil in me the rudiments of Greek, Latin and Euclid, besides a thirst for wider knowledge.<br><br>But I run ahead of my tale.<br><br>Hannah Wellcome, my foster-mother, appeared good-natured and buxom: round red cheeks and untidy yellow ringlets escaping from her cap would predispose a stranger in her favour. I believe a certain native cunning had incited her to marry as she had done, thereby endowing herself with a propitious name and the status of a matron; Tom, her husband, kept in the background and was seldom seen; a narrow, dark, lantern-jawed ferret of a man, he scurried among the lanes on questionable pursuits of his own. But she, smiling and curtseying at the door of their thatched cottage, her ample bulk arrayed in clean apron, tucker and cap, might easily create an impression of kindly honesty, and had, at any one time, as many small clients as the house would hold.<br><br>The house, whitewashed and in its own garden, lay at the far end of a straggling hamlet sunk deep in a coombe. Our muddy street wound its way, like a crease through a green and crumpled counterpane, between steeply tilted meadows and dense patches of woodland, close to the border of Somerset and Devon. There were no more than twenty dwellings in all, besides the small ancient church presided over by Dr Moultrie. He had, as well, another village in his cure, perched high on the windy moor seven miles westwards. This was Over Othery. From long-established use and local custom, our hamlet, Nether Othery, was never thus referred to, but always, by the country folk round about, given the title of 'Byblow Bottom'.<br><br>I write, now, of days long since passed away, when it was still the habit amongst all ladies of the gentle classes no matter how modest their degree, even the wives of attorneys, vicars, and well-to-do tradesmen, not to suckle their own infants, but always to put them out to wet-nurse. The bosoms of ladies, it seemed, were not for use, but strictly for show (and indeed, at the time I am recalling, bosoms were very much in evidence, bunched up over skimpy high-waisted dresses and concealed by little more than a twist of gauze and a scrap of cambric; what with that, and the fashion for wearing dampened petticoats and thin little kid slippers out of doors, very many young ladies must have gone to their ends untimely, thereby throwing even more business in the way of foster-mothers). Whatever the reason, it was held that the babies of the upper classes throve and grew faster when fed and tended by women of a lower order, and so the new-born infant would be directly dispatched, perhaps merely from one end of a village to the other, perhaps half across England to some baronial estate, to be reared in a cottage for two, three, or even four years, while its own mother, if so minded, need never lay eyes on it for that space of time. Of course I do not say this was the rule; many mothers, no doubt, visited their children very diligently, very constantly; but many others, I am equally sure, did not.</p><h2>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (The Illustrated Edition)</h2><p>New Copy.

It reminded me so much of the bicycle shop he had when I was a kid. Even the large display windows, shaded by a colorful striped awning, were the same. Outside my dad's shop, there were flower boxes full of red blossoms&#x2014;impatiens&#x2014;that spilled over beneath the large windows. That was Mom's contribution: impatiens in the spring and summer, chrysanthemums in the fall and shiny green mistletoe at Christmas. I plan to have flowers, too.<br><br>Dad's business grew steadily and he moved into increasingly larger premises, but I always loved his first store best.<br><br>I must have astounded the rental agent who was showing me the property. She'd barely unlocked the front door when I announced, "I'll take it."<br><br>She turned to face me, her expression blank as if she wasn't sure she'd heard me correctly. "Wouldn't you like to see the place? You do realize there's a small apartment above the shop that comes with it, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes, you mentioned that earlier." The apartment worked perfectly for me. My cat, Whiskers, and I were in need of a home.<br><br>"You <em>would</em> like to see the place before you sign the papers, wouldn't you?" she persisted.<br><br>I smiled and nodded. But it wasn't really necessary; instinctively I knew this was the ideal location for my yarn shop. And for me.<br><br>The one drawback was that this Seattle neighborhood was undergoing extensive renovations and, because of the construction mess, Blossom Street was closed at one end, with only local traffic allowed. The brick building across the street, which had once been a three-story bank, was being transformed into highend condos. Several other buildings, including an old warehouse, were also in the process of becoming condos. The architect had somehow managed to maintain the traditional feel of the original places, and that delighted me. Construction would continue for months, but it did mean that my rent was reasonable, at least for now.<br><br>I knew the first six months would be difficult. They are for any small business. The constant construction might create more obstacles than there otherwise would have been; nevertheless, I loved the space. It was everything I wanted.<br><br>Early Friday morning, a week after viewing the property, I signed my name, Lydia Hoffman, to the two-year lease. I was handed the keys and a copy of the rental agreement. I moved into my new home that very day, as excited as I can remember being about anything. I felt as if I was just starting my life and in more ways than I care to count, I actually was.<br><br>I opened A Good Yarn on the last Tuesday in April. I felt a sense of pride and anticipation as I stood in the middle of my store, surveying the colors that surrounded me. I could only imagine what my sister would say when she learned I'd gone through with this. I hadn't asked her advice because I already knew what Margaret's response would be. She isn't&#x2014;to put it mildly&#x2014;the encouraging type.<br><br>I'd found a carpenter who'd built some cubicles for me, three rows of them, painted a pristine white. Most of the yarn had arrived on Friday and I'd spent the weekend sorting it by weight and color and arranging it neatly in the cubicles. I'd bought a secondhand cash register, refinished the counter and set up racks of knitting supplies. I was ready for business.<br><br>This should have been a happy moment for me but instead, I found myself struggling to hold back tears. Dad would've been so pleased if he could have seen what I'd done. He'd been my support and my source of strength, my guiding light. I was so shocked when he died.<br><br>You see, I'd always assumed I would die before my father.<br><br>Most people find talk of death unsettling, but I've lived with the threat of it for so long, it doesn't have that effect on me. The possibility of death has been my reality for the last fourteen years, and I'm as comfortable talking about it as I am the weather.<br><br>My first bout with cancer came the summer I turned sixteen. I'd gone to pick up my driver's license that day in August. I'd successfully passed both the written and the driving tests. My mother let me drive from the licensing office to the optometrist. It was supposed to be a routine appointment&#x2014;I was having my eyes examined before the start of my junior year of high school. I had big plans for the day. As soon as I got home from the eye doctor's, Becky and I were going to drive to the beach. It would be the first time I'd taken the car out by myself, and I was looking forward to driving without my mom or dad or my older sister.<br><br>I recall being upset that Mom had scheduled the eye appointment right after my driving test. I'd been having some problems with headaches and dizzy spells, and Dad thought I might need reading glasses. The idea of showing up at Lincoln High School wearing glasses bothered me. A lot. I was hoping Mom and Dad would agree to let me wear contact lenses. As it turned out, impaired vision was the least of my worries.<br><br>The optometrist, who was a friend of my parents, seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time staring into the corner of my eye with this horribly bright light. He asked a lot of questions about my headaches. That was almost fifteen years ago, but I don't think I'll ever forget the look on his face as he talked to my mother. He was so serious, so somber...so concerned.<br><br>"I want to make Lydia an appointment at the University of Washington. Immediately."<br><br>My mother and I were both stunned. "All right," my mother said, glancing from me to Dr. Reid and back again. "Is there a problem?"<br><br>He nodded. "I don't like what I'm seeing. I think it would be best if Dr. Wilson had a look."<br><br>Well, Dr. Wilson did more than look. He drilled into my skull and removed a malignant brain tumor. I say those words glibly now, but it wasn't a quick or simple procedure. It meant weeks in the hospital and blinding, debilitating headaches. After the surgery, I went through chemotherapy, followed by a series of radiation treatments. There were days when even the dimmest of lights caused such pain it was all I could do not to scream in agony. Days when I measured each breath, struggling to hold on to life because, try as I might, I could feel it slipping away. Still, there were many mornings I woke up and wished I <em>would</em> die because I couldn't bear another hour of this. Without my father I'm convinced I would have.<br><br>My head was completely shaved and then, once my hair started to grow back, it fell out again. I missed my entire junior year and when I was finally able to return to high school, nothing was the same. Everyone looked at me differently. I didn't attend the Junior-Senior prom because no one asked me. Some girlfriends suggested I tag along with them, but out of false pride I refused. In retrospect it seems a trivial thing to worry about. I wish I'd gone.<br><br>The saddest part of this story is that just when I was beginning to believe I could have a normal life&#x2014;just when I believed all those drugs, all that suffering had served a useful purpose&#x2014;the tumor grew back.<br><br>I'll never forget the day Dr. Wilson told us the cancer had returned. But it's not the expression on his face that I remember. It's the pain in my father's eyes. He, above anyone, understood what I'd endured during the first bout of treatment. My mother doesn't deal well with illness, and Dad was the one who'd held me together emotionally. He knew there was nothing he could do, nothing he could say, that would lessen this second ordeal for me. I was twenty-four at the time and still in college, trying to accumulate enough credits to graduate. I never did get that degree.<br><br>I've survived both bouts of cancer, and I'm definitely not the carefree girl I once was. I appreciate and treasure every single day because I know how precious life is. Most people assume I'm younger than thirty but they seem to find me more serious than other women my age. My experience with cancer means I don't take anything, least of all life itself, for granted. I no longer greet each day with careless acceptance.<br><br>But I've learned there are compensations for my suffering. I know I'd be a completely different person if not for the cancer. My dad claimed I achieved a certain calm wisdom, and I suppose I have. Yet in many ways I'm naive, especially when it comes to men and relationships.<br><br>Of all the compensations, the one I'm most grateful for is that while undergoing treatment I learned to knit.<br><br>I may have survived cancer twice, but unfortunately my father didn't. My second tumor killed him. That's what my sister Margaret believes. She's never actually said so, but I know it's what she thinks. The truth is, I suspect she's probably right. It was a heart attack, but he aged so much after that second diagnosis I'm sure it affected his health. I knew that if he could've switched places with me, he would have done it gladly.<br><br>He was at my bedside as much as possible. That, in particular, is what Margaret can't seem to forgive or forget&#x2014;the time and devotion Dad gave me throughout this ordeal. Mom, too, as much as she was emotionally able.<br><br>Margaret was married and a mother of two before the second tumor was even discovered. Nevertheless, she seems to assume that she's somehow been cheated because of my cancer. To this day, she acts as if being sick was my <em>choice,</em> an option I preferred over a normal life.<br><br>It goes without saying that my sister and I have a strained relationship. For Mom's sake, especially now that Dad's gone, I try my best with Margaret. She doesn't make it easy. She can't hide her resentment, no matter how many years it's been.<br><br>Margaret was against my opening a yarn shop, but I sincerely doubt she would've encouraged me in any undertaking. I swear, her eyes brightened at the prospect of seeing me fail. According to the statistics, most new businesses do go under&#x2014;usually within a year&#x2014;but I still felt I had to give the yarn shop a chance.<br><br>I had the funds. The money was actually an inheritance I received from my maternal grandmother who died when I was twelve. Dad invested it wisely and I had a small nest egg. I should have probably saved it for what Mom calls a "rainy day," but it's been raining every day since I turned sixteen and I was tired of holding on to it. Deep down, I know Dad would approve.<br><br>As I said, I learned to knit while undergoing chemotherapy. Over the years I've become an accomplished knitter. Dad always joked that I had enough yarn to open my own store; recently I decided he was right.<br><br>I love to knit. There's a comfort to it that I can't entirely explain. The repetition of weaving the yarn around a needle and then forming a stitch creates a sense of purpose, of achievement, of progress. When your entire world is unraveling, you tend to crave order, and I found it in knitting. In fact, I've even read that knitting can lower stress more effectively than meditation. And I guess for me it was a better approach, because there was something tangible to show for it. Maybe because knitting gave me a sense of action, of <em>doing</em> something. I didn't know what tomorrow held, but with a pair of needles in my hands and a ball of yarn in my lap, I was confident I could handle whatever lay ahead. Each stitch was an accomplishment. Some days all I could manage was a single row, but I had the satisfaction of that one small achievement. It made a difference to me. A very big difference.<br><br>Over the years I've taught a number of people how to knit. My first students were other cancer patients going through chemotherapy. We met at the Seattle Oncology Center, and before long, I had everyone, men included, knitting cotton washcloths. I think every doctor and nurse in that clinic has enough knit washcloths to last a lifetime! After washcloths, I had my band of beginning knitters move on to a small afghan. Certainly I've had some failures but far more successes. My patience was rewarded when others found the same serenity I did in knitting.<br><br>Now I have my own shop and I think the best way to get customers in the door is to offer knitting classes. I'd never sell enough yarn to stay in business if I ran classes in washcloths, so I've chosen a simple baby blanket to start with. The pattern's by one of my favorite designers, Ann Norling, and uses the basic knit and purl stitches.<br><br>I don't know what to expect of my new venture, but I'm hopeful. Hope to a person with cancer&#x2014;or to a person who's had cancer&#x2014;is more potent than any drug. We live on it, live for it. It's addictive to those of us who've learned to take one day at a time.<br><br>I was making a sign advertising my beginners' class when the bell above the door chimed. My first customer had just walked in and I looked up with a smile on my face. The pounding excitement in my heart quickly died when I realized it was Margaret.<br><br>"Hi," I said, doing my best to sound happy to see her. I didn't want my sister showing up on my very first morning and attacking my confidence.<br><br>"Mom told me you'd decided to go ahead with this idea of yours."<br><br>I didn't respond.<br><br>Frowning, Margaret continued. "I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by and see the shop."<br><br>I gestured with one arm and hated myself for asking. "What do you think?" I didn't bother to mention that Blossom Street was decidedly out of her way.<br><br>"Why'd you name it A Good Yarn?"<br><br>I'd gone over dozens of shop names, some too cute by half, some plain and ordinary. I love the idea that "spinning a yarn" means telling a story, and sharing stories with people, listening to their experiences, is important to me. Another legacy of the clinic, I suppose. A Good Yarn seems like a warm and welcoming name. But I didn't explain all that to Margaret. "I wanted my customers to know I sell quality yarn."<br><br></p><h2>Piper</h2><p>When Piper the dog&#39;s grim new master treats him badly, he is terrified and runs away to the big city where his courage and desire to please makes him a hero and finds him a new, loving home.</p><p><p>Piper is a gentle dog, courageous and anxious to please.

It took a moment more to definitively focus his senses: A warm tongue was leaving a cool path....<br> &nbsp;<br> He shifted his powerful body slightly, the sensation exquisite. A faint smile lifted the corners of his mouth in pleasurable remembrance of the woman&#x2019;s special skills, and a second later his vivid blue eyes opened. Reaching down, his fingers lazily slid through honey-colored silken curls, and he murmured, his deep voice still drowsy, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever sleep?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d met Mary Holm two days ago in Kelso at a country inn where her acrobatic troupe was staying. She&#x2019;d caught his eyes deliberately and then came up to him where he stood watching his men throwing dice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mary,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, looking up at the tall, dark-haired Border Lord with an open invitation in her eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> And after a long afternoon of sampling Wat Harden&#x2019;s special reserve French brandy, he let his gaze drift downward briefly to the luscious swell of her bosom before returning to her sweetly smiling face, and he&#x2019;d simply said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way home. Are you hungry?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;d hardly been out of bed since Tuesday.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, if we weren&#x2019;t leaving for Berwick on Friday, darling Johnnie,&#x201d; the pretty young woman replied, lifting her head to smile at the Laird of Ravensby with cheerful impudence, &#x201c;I might be inclined to sleep. But who knows when I&#x2019;ll have such a bonny stud to entertain me again?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was fully awake now, and his own grin matched hers. &#x201c;In that case I&#x2019;ll try to last till Friday.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing gracious fine,&#x201d; she purred, and with a wink, resumed her pleasuring.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the muddy forest road south of Goldiehouse that evening, an exhausted rider whipped his lathered horse to more speed, every minute of delay terrible in its consequences. Like all Borderers, he knew the countryside even at night with the moon behind more threatening rain clouds. Now if his mount would just hold out....&nbsp;He swore under his breath as the black stallion faltered in the rough going and, taking pity on his Laird&#x2019;s best bloodstock, eased the pace. But even as he drew the horse to a trot, he debated whether his chieftain would rather he ride the black barb to death, so urgent was his message.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come sit on me,&#x201d; Johnnie softly said, touching Mary&#x2019;s chin with a finger. &#x201c;I like the feel of you....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rising in a lithe movement, her slender body, supple, feline, she stroked his splendid arousal and answered, &#x201c;And I adore the feel of you, my darling Laird.&#x201d; She grinned as she moved over him. &#x201c;How pleasant to discover all the stories are true.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re testing my stamina, pet,&#x201d; Johnnie murmured, aware of the stories but disinclined to discuss his reputation as stud to the Middle Marches. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not complaining,&#x201d; he added with a small smile, gently placing his palms on her hips as she slid down his erection, his eyes closing against the delicious friction. &#x201c;God, you&#x2019;re tight....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mary&#x2019;s own blue eyes were half-closed, as profligate sensation flooded her mind. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re enormous....&#x201d; she whispered into the firelit room, feeling his hard, rigid length stretch her. Her back arched against the delirium. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my lovely rutting stallion,&#x201d; she breathed, the exquisite feel of Johnnie Carre filling her.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bedchamber was utterly silent for a time, the small sounds of the crackling fire distinct in the hushed, charged atmosphere. She moved down, he arched up. And they both caught their breath for that moment of indelible glory. Then she&#x2019;d glide upward again with riveting slowness. And they&#x2019;d both breathe again.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a languorous rhythm, not impatient after two wanton days in bed but feverishly acute after forty-eight hours of sexual excess. Extravagant, luxurious feeling reigned. No distractions tempered the irrepressible passion.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then, overzealous once, Johnnie penetrated too deeply, and she cried out. Instantly remorseful, he touched her rosy cheek, his fingers as gentle as his voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Am I hurting you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It took her a shuddering moment to open her eyes and a moment more to answer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; she ambiguously replied, her words uttered with a soft, breathy sigh.<br> &nbsp;<br> He understood what she meant; he was an experienced man. But he cautioned himself to more control. She was small and fragile, and it was possible to do damage.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fatigued horseman spurred the black stallion up the last incline to Goldiehouse, no longer concerned with his mount&#x2019;s failing strength. Only a few hundred yards remained of his breakneck ride. Galloping through the courtyard gate, he shouted to rouse the household, the lantern-lit court empty. Throwing himself off the winded barb, he collapsed on the courtyard flags, damp and puddle-strewn from days of rain, just as the studded door to the old keep burst open. With drawn swords three clansmen bolted through the massive doorway, their jackboots like mallets on the cobblestones. Spread-eagle like a dead man on the wet ground, the messenger spoke, breathless, panting.<br> &nbsp;<br> And they stopped cold when they heard his words.<br> &nbsp;<br> Johnnie was unaware of the tumult, his private quarters of the last few days distant by his choice from the daily bustle. His attention at the moment was totally absorbed, his climax imminent.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mary Holm&#x2019;s arms were laced tightly around his neck, her breasts warm and soft against his chest, her sleek rhythm increasing in intensity. Her body was damp with sweat; his own temperature feverish; he could feel the heat of his arousal as if a tropical sun had invaded the massive stone walls and raftered ceiling of the room. Her agitated breathing warmed his neck; his strong fingers possessively captured her narrow waist, exerting a minute pressure at times that caused small, breath-held pauses while they both gathered new air into their lungs.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m dying,&#x201d; she breathed.<br> &nbsp;<br> He shook his head, a small movement of negation, all he was capable of at the moment. Never, he thought, and if he&#x2019;d had the capacity, he&#x2019;d have smiled.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reaching up suddenly, she twisted her fingers into his unruly black hair, jerked his face downward, and kissed him, devoured him, frantically ate at his mouth, greedy for the feel and taste of him everywhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt her begin to quiver, his own release racing downward.<br> &nbsp;<br> � � �<br> &nbsp;<br> Two Carre clansmen raced through the first-floor corridors, took the wide, shallow steps three at a time to the second floor, and ran full out to the narrow staircase at the back of the west wing, taking the corners in flying swoops. They sprinted up the narrow circular stairwell of the original tower1, their hearts beating a frantic tattoo. Johnnie had left orders that he not be disturbed, but neither questioned the need to disobey. In the medieval portion of Goldiehouse the ceilings were low, the hallways narrow, built for defense centuries ago. Only one man could comfortably navigate the corridors. One racing after the other, they dashed toward the small room at the end of the passage.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lord, she was hot&nbsp;...&nbsp;on fire, Johnnie reflected as he exploded in orgasm, agonizing bliss convulsing his senses, the world diminished for brief seconds to one small woman in his arms and incredible sensation.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was amazing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Which exact thought was passing through Mary Holm&#x2019;s mind as she lay overcome, panting, Johnnie Carre living up to his amorous fame. He was truly amazing&nbsp;...&nbsp;again.<br> &nbsp;<br> She licked him like a contented cat, her warm tongue tracing a slow path across his muscled shoulder. She felt him tense minutely. His head lifted suddenly, and a second later he shifted her in his arms, unconsciously readying himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then he heard it clearly. The faint pattern of running feet. When he&#x2019;d made it clear his privacy was sacrosanct.<br> &nbsp;<br> He lifted her from him in a flash of movement, set her against the pillows with a curious tenderness considering his blurring speed, and gallantly threw the embroidered sheet over her just as the door burst open.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d only half turned from her, his peripheral vision searching out the intruders, when the brutal exclamation struck him like a blow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve taken Robbie!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no need to define who &#x201c;they&#x201d; were. The same enemy had confronted the Roxburgh Carres for a thousand years.<br> &nbsp;<br> He leaped from the bed, reaching for his weapons left conveniently on the bedpost. The Borders had been Scotland&#x2019;s battleground since the dim dawn of history; a man&#x2019;s dirk and sword never left his side.<br> &nbsp;<br> His men swiftly related the facts of his brother&#x2019;s abduction as Johnnie gathered his clothes, the woman forgotten. His questions were harsh staccato queries, his dark brows drawn together in a scowl at the answers. His leather breeches were on in seconds, his boots jerked on next, his shirt thrown over his shoulders followed by his leather jack. Handing his sword belt to a clansman to carry, he strode from the room, closing his shirt, tucking it into his leather breeches with rough thrusts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Halfway down the second-floor corridor he remembered Mary Holm. &#x201c;See that the girl is sent back to Kelso with an escort,&#x201d; he curtly said, buckling his jack shut, reaching out for his sword baldric. Taking the belt from his lieutenant, he slipped it over his shoulder. &#x201c;Give her a purse and my thanks. Are the horses saddled?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At a nod he adjusted the dirk at his waist, pulled his sword slightly out of its scabbard to test its feel, jammed it back in, and, in a voice harsh with hatred, growled, &#x201c;Damned Godfrey! Damned English! They&#x2019;re fucking vermin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Descending the broad balustraded stairway in long, racing leaps, he broke into a run immediately he reached the main floor. &#x201c;How long ago was it?&#x201d; he asked again of the man keeping pace with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> His muttered curse at the unpalatable reply reflected everyone&#x2019;s unease.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A house in sicily</h2><p>A memoir as delightfully captivating as <i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i>, the story of one woman starting a new life in the "most beautiful house in Sicily. <p>When artists and writers like Tennessee Williams, Bertrand Russell, Roald Dahl, and the painter Henry Faulkner visited Sicily, they stayed at Casa Cuseni, a perfectly proportioned house built in golden stone on a hillside rising near Mount Etna. For fifty years, this has been the home of Daphne Phelps, who now tells its story with warmth, charm, and style. </p><p>In 1947, with barely any Italian and precious little money, the war-weary, thirty-four-year-old Daphne arrived in Taormina to sell the house she had unexpectedly inherited. Instead, she fell in love with the house and its gardens, the community and its way of life. To raise enough money to keep her magical inheritance, Daphne ran Casa Cuseni as a pensione, receiving a variety of illustrious guests. </p><p>No less important are the local Sicilians with whom she shared the love and care of Casa Cuseni: Don Ciccio, the town's own Mafia don; Vincenzio, the general manservant who recited poetry while he served the meals; Beppe, a Don Juan who scented his eyebrows and mustache; and above all the steadfast cook and housekeeper, Concetta, who lives with Daphne in her house in Sicily still.</p></p><p>"I had always been a bit of a maverick," writes Daphne Phelps, looking back on why--at the age of 34--when she unexpectedly inherited a grand house in Taormina, Sicily, she gave up her profession in London, left behind her ordered life with its museums, theater, family and friends, and embarked on a life-long adventure. Reading her intriguing memoir, one is glad Phelps chose the unconventional path: after inheriting her uncle's Casa Cuseni with its terraced gardens and staggering views of Mt. Etna, she struggles to make ends meet, but instead of selling the estate, opens its doors to a steady stream of paying guests and visitors--many of them artists, writers, and intellectuals. <p> Inheriting an estate in Italy in 1947 isn't quite like winning the lottery, it turns out. In short sketches, Phelps reminisces about stepping into small-town Sicilian life, war-weary, speaking very little Italian, and even more scandalous, being unmarried. With her no-nonsense British humor, she recounts the typical conversation with men, young and old:<br> "Are you married?"<br> "No."<br> "When are you going to get married?"<br> "<i>Chi lo sa</i>--who knows?'" <br> And then, "Why aren't you married?"</p> <p> Settling into daily life at Casa Cuseni, Phelps dons boots and digs into the garden, rolls up her sleeves and cleans the baroque carvings over the salon fireplace, and learns to manage the property and its full-time staff. As she points out in the book's conclusion, for more than 50 years now, house-related problems have kept her on her toes--those, and her amazingly devoted servant, cook, and even the local Mafia don, whom she all describes with more than a little condescension in a series of deft portraits. While Phelps's cynicism can be a bit hard to take when she's serving up her servants, she is, perhaps, at her best when telling stories about her famous houseguests: Bertrand Russell, Henry Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, even Roald Dahl. Some were charming, some were horrid. But the visitors came from 26 countries, with friends introducing their friends. Around the dining room table and in this volume Phelps has mixed people who in "normal life would be unlikely to meet." It is this Sicilian menagerie--anchored to a singular place and time, and viewed through a British prism--that makes Phelps's life story so worth the telling. <i>--Kimberly Brown</i></p></p><h2>What Doctors Don&#39;t Tell You:: The Truth About The Dangers Of Modern Medicine</h2><p>Americans have become so accustomed to following doctors' orders that many prescriptions, medical tests, and surgical procedures are accepted without question.

Desperate, Hunter turns to Eliza Flyte, the horsemaster's daughter, who has inherited her father's gift for gentling horses. Her ability to heal wounded spirits with her compassion and wisdom is amazing, and when Hunter convinces her to leave her isolated island and return home with him, she soon applies that gift to the bitter man and his grieving, motherless children. But what future can a woman raised alone by her father with only the sea, animals, and a few books for companions have with a man who grew up as a rich, upper-class son of the South? It seems unlikely that Eliza could ever fit into Hunter's world and just as unlikely that he would give up his privileged life for her world. It just may take a miracle for these two mismatched lovers to find a way to live happily ever after.</p><p> In this novel, centered on the brother of the hero from the bestseller <i>The Charm School</i>, the cynical hero who has nearly given up on life is balanced by a heroine who has enough faith and wisdom for them both.

He takes us on a bold, seductive journey through his childhood and adolescence, a quixotic child&#39;s eye view along Jerusalem&#39;s wartorn streets in the 1940s and &#39;50s, and into the infernal marriage of two kind, well-meaning people: his fussy, logical father, and his dreamy, romantic mother. Caught between them is one small boy with the weight of generations on his shoulders. And at the tragic heart of the tale is the suicide of his mother, when Amos was twelve-and-a-half years old. Soon after, still a gawky adolescent, he left home, changed his name and became a tractor driver on a kibbutz. &#39;Jews go back to Palestine&#39; urged the graffiti in 1930s Lithuania, so they went; then later the walls of Europe shouted &#39;Jews get out of Palestine&#39;.

Just look at those dogs (you might say), what a tail-wagging, chop-licking, howling good time they're having. And see if your dog doesn't agree.<br><br> Try In a Nutshell, the classic sleight-of-hand game, by hiding a treat under one of three plastic cups. The Lawrence Welk--dogs love to chase soap bubbles even more than toddlers do. Get fit while playing. Or use Subliminal Advertising, which works by sneaking a favorite word like cookie into an otherwise boring rant. You'll be surprised by how closely your dog pays attention to what you say, and how broad the smile will be when he hears that special word. Just be sure to have said cookie on hand.</p><p>Jenny Langbehn is a veterinary nurse and the resident dog whisperer at Lenox Hill Vets in Manhattan, as well as a prenatal yoga teacher, birth doula, and childbirth educator.

Written by Andrew Sarris, the theory's chief advocate, the book traces the history of movies by examining the careers of more than 200 film directors. Covering everyone from D.W. Griffith to Francis Coppola, Orson Welles to Roman Polanski, Sarris argues that directorial greatness is marked by a personal style and consistency of excellence that can be traced throughout a career. Sarris's commentary is sometimes worshipful, sometimes acrid, but almost always quotable. Alfred Hitchcock is "the supreme technician of the American cinema." John Huston coasted "on his reputation as a wronged individualist with an alibi for every bad movie." Stanley Kubrick holds "a naive faith in the power of images to transcend fuzzy feelings and vague ideas." Michelangelo Antonioni makes films so pessimistic and alienating that Sarris dubs him "Antoniennui."<p> You may not agree with all of Sarris's assessments, but this book provides the best possible opportunity to consider auteurism, an approach to cinema that, in an age that reveres Scorsese, Spielberg, and Tarantino, seems more relevant than ever. The book closes with an essay called "The Auteur Theory Revised," Sarris's attempt at a definitive theoretical statement. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p><b>Andrew Sarris</b> is film critic for the<i>New York Observer</i> and professor of cinema at Columbia University.

Our reading program for grades 2-7 continues the development of reading skills. Reading is not a passive activity for pleasure. Reading requires an active, discriminating mind that is challenged to think, compare, and contrast. Students who have been challenged by good literature will never be satisfied with the poor-quality books that are so readily available today.<br>Literature study guides train students to become active readers. Our guides focus on vocabulary, spelling, comprehension, and composition skills. Words to pronounce and spell prepare students for each chapter and words to define build vocabulary. Comprehension questions teach students to think about what they have read and to learn to identify the important content of each story. Comprehension questions also teach students the advanced skill of composing a clear, concise answer to a question, a difficult skill at any age. Writing is thinking, and good questioning stimulates the child to think and to write.<br><i>The Door in the Wall</i> is a wonderful children's story about a disadvantaged boy in medieval England who learns the virtues of strength and patience.</p><p></p><h2>The Adventures of The Woman Homesteader: The Life and Letters of Elinore Pruitt Stewart (Women in the West)</h2><p>Generations of readers have delighted in Elinore Pruitt Stewart's <i>Letters of a Woman Homesteader</i> (1914) and <i>Letters on an Elk Hunt</i> (1915), among the most engaging accounts of life in the American West. Stewart related her adventures on an isolated Wyoming homestead with such vividness, gusto, and sympathy that she has become the woman homesteader. Until now, however, little has been known about her except what she chose to reveal in her published letters. <p>Old friends and new acquaintances alike will welcome this book combining Stewart's previously unpublished or uncollected letters with Susanne K. George's extensive research.

In an afterword George considers Stewart's use of fictional devices and her growth as a writer as well as her place in American letters.</p></p><p>Susanne K. George is an associate professor of English at the University of Nebraska-Kearney who specializes in western and women&#39;s literature.Despite a life of extreme poverty and hard work homesteading on the Wyoming frontier, Elinore Pruitt Stewart (1876-1933) found time to record her experiences working the land in correspondence to family and friends and to publish it as Letters of a Woman Homesteader in 1914. George, an associate professor of English at the University of Nebraska, has compiled and edited Stewart's unpublished letters and stories together with interesting biographical research. From it, she theorizes that Stewart's published letters were less authentic and more skillfully crafted than thought at the time and that they gave a partially fictionalized picture of frontier life. The letters, which will be of interest to feminist historians, reveal Stewart as a joyful and talented survivor who wrote powerfully, particularly about the natural world, and earned her place in literary history.

In this best&#x2013;selling classic,A.W. Pink answers such profound questions in a language the average Christian layperson will find not only understandable but totally engaging. Pink, one of the most influential evangelical authors of the last century, writes with fiery passion and brilliant clarity, giving biblical answers to our deepest questions regarding the <br>sadly neglected and little understood doctrine of the sovereignty of God.</p><p>Arthur Walkington Pink (1886-1952) was an evangelist and biblical scholar known for Calvinist and Puritan teachings. Born in England, Pink became a Christian in his early 20&#39;s and immigrated to the United States to study at Moody Bible Institute. After marrying in 1916 he went on to pastor churches in Australia and England before returning to the U. S. to pastor churches in Colorado, California, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Pink returned to England in 1934, turning his Christian service to writing books and pamphlets. After Pink&#39;s death, his works were republished by the Banner of Truth Trust and reached a much wider audience as a result, making him one of the most influential evangelical authors in the second half of the twentieth century. His writing sparked a revival of expository preaching and focused readers&#39; hearts on biblical living. His works include numerous Bible studies and books such as &#34;The Attibrutes of God,&#34; &#34;The Doctrine of Justification,&#34; &#34;The Patience of God,&#34;and &#34;The Total Depravity of Man.&#34;</p><h2>Harcourt Brace Social Studies: United States Florida Edition</h2><p>Harcourt Brace Social Studies: United States Florida Edition</p><p></p><h2>Outrageous good fortune</h2><p>Presentation copy, Signed by the Author.

She illustrated many books by other authors before she started to write her own picture books. Her own family, two sons and a daughter, were very young then and she learned the craft of storytelling mostly by reading to them. Her books have won many awards and are published in Europe, China, Japan, and the Far East, as well as Australia, Canada, the U. K., and the U. S. A. She travels widely, talking to and drawing for children in schools and libraries as well as at adult conventions. </p><p>Shirley is married to an architect, now retired, and they have lived in the same family house, overlooking a London square garden, for more than forty years. They have, to date, six grandchildren who keep them on their toes.</p><p>In Her Own Words...</p><p>"I grew up in a nice, quiet, well-behaved suburb of Liverpool. But our uneventful lives were rudely interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Wewent to school carrrying gas masks, did air-raid shelter drills, saved Up mountains of scrap metal, and attempted to knit Mufflers for the troops. (Mine were very long; I never quite got the hang of casting off.) I slept under the stairs (hiring the winter of the big blitz, when we saw the sky over Liverpool lit by searchlights, tracer bullets, and Fires from the burning docks.</p><p>"All this may sound very exciting, But the problem with wartime is that when it's not frightening, it's deadly dull. You can't go on holiday, the grown-ups are too harassed and exhausted to pay much attention to amusements, and every nice kind of food is scarce. I recall, on a rare trip to the seaside (the beach was out of bounds, full of barbed wire and concrete gun emplacements), gazing at a longempty slot machine which had held chocolate bars and now seemed like a rusting icon from another world.</p><p>"Nevertheless, we managed to have a good time. We drew a lot, read and wrote stories, and got up magazines. (Mine was called, rather unoriginally, 'Girl's Own.) We acted plays, dressed in homemade costumes, to any audience we could press into service, cats included. Later, we became hopelessly stageand movie-struck. I think that by accident I had an ideal childhood for an illustrator. In a pre-televisual age, our Sunday afternoon outings, if we were lucky, were to Liverpool Art Gallery, which was cram-full of Victorian an narrative paintings with titles like 'The Hopeless Dawn,' 'Too Late!,' and 'When Did You Last See Your Father?' Tremendous stuff, and it fueled my lifelong conviction that stories and pictures belong together. I think most children probably feel the same.</p><p>"With me, drawing and painting stuck. I was never much good at anything else, so I went on doing them. Writing was a secret thing, kept well under wraps. When I emerged from art school, I wrote to a distinguished typographer saying I wanted to illustrate children's books. He wrote back saying that this was impossible 'except as an adjunct to teaching or matrimony.' All the same, I was determined to do it.</p><p>"When I think of an idea for a story, it always starts with a very strong image in my head, usually of a child doing something. With picture books, the words are unthinkable without the images-the two develop together, like a film. Alfie first made his appearance running up the street ahead of his mum, who came trundling behind with the shopping and his baby sister, Annie Rose, in the buggy. I knew from the first moment I reached for a pencil to get down a rough drawing of him that he was positively pink in the face with determination to get into the action. A lot has happened to him-and to mesince. He is a very ordinary little boy, a kind of fouryear-old Everyman just beginning to come to grips with the complexities of life. Now, rather to my amazement, well over two million Alfie books have been sold worldwide. But I still relate back to that rapid sketch done in a state of high excitement, which is where it all began."</p>Ages 2^-6. Like all Hughes' wonderful picture books, this alphabet story is set in a toddler's world filled with affection and excitement and a messy, relaxed sense of play. For each letter, there is a happy scenario, a simple story to talk about ("S is for seaside, swimming, and sand castles"), with four-year-old Alfie and his little sister, Annie Rose. Some are ebullient ("F is for friends"). Some are quiet ("I is for the insects Alfie loves to find under rocks") and poetic ("M is for moon. A silver light, always changing shape. Magic moon"). Those who know other Alfie books will recognize the cast of neighbors, friends, and extended family, including the MacNally family who live across the street and are the center of <i>Alfie and the Birthday Surprise</i> [<i>BKL</i> Mr. 1 98]. From the opening picture of Alfie, Annie Rose, and Mom curled up with a book, children will be drawn into the exuberant pictures and will pore over the loving, active details again and again. They will learn the alphabet and the joy of reading about themselves in a book. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Last Tales of Uncle Remus</h2><p>Retells the final adventures and misadventures of Brer Rabbit and his friends and enemies</p><p>The fourth volume of a landmark retelling completes the roster, with Lester's witty contemporary voice (``I reckon I should push the pause button on this story `cause you want to know how the axe could see her coming,'' or, ``she did the laundry and...the colored clothes stood up and started singing a commercial'') still serving the original tales' subversive humor with splendid originality. In a quiet, well-reasoned introductory essay on why he kept the name ``Uncle Remus,'' Lester points out that ``without the distinctive voice of the narrator, the stories would not have endured,'' though, ironically, ``Harris's Uncle Remus also represents...the servile `darky.' '' Still, ``this should not blind us to his contribution or cause us to withdraw respect from him. Each of us is as complex and contradictory, and that is the beauty of being human.'' Some of the 39 stories here are less familiar than those in the earlier volumes, but no less entertaining when rendered in Lester's companionable style (from delightful description--''He ran away from there so fast, his shadow had to hitchhike home''--to sharp commentary--''When a man looks at the world through hungry eyes, everything looks good to eat''; quoting is seductive). Again, variants of other tales (e.g., Richard Chase's) make for interesting contrasts, and Pinkney provides several handsome color spreads (seen), plus dozens of drawings (not seen). Essential. (Folklore. 7+) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 4-8-This is the fourth volume of retellings of African-American folktales that were first collected by Joel Chandler Harris in the late 19th-century Reconstruction South. As before, Lesteruses Uncle Remus as narrator and, as before, he is a forceful, witty, and cunning storyteller rather than the subservient character of Harris's creation. Many of these 39 selections are pourquoi tales, such as "Why the Cricket Has Elbows on His Legs" and "Why Brer Possum Has No Hair on His Tail." Several stories feature that hero of heroes, Brer Rabbit, but he does not dominate the tales as in the earlier books. These tales are darker in tone than the stories usually associated with Harris's characters. They show capricious and violent tricks of fate that surely mirrored closely the lives of the slaves who told them. As in the previous books, Lester has done a stellar job in the retelling. Pinkney's watercolor illustrations have the same verve and interest as before.

They embody our society&#x2019;s genetic code. In the masterful hands of the subject&#x2019;s greatest living historian, the story of the evolution of our laws serves to lay bare the deciding struggles over power and justice that have shaped this country from its birth pangs to the present. <b>Law in America</b> is a supreme example of the historian&#x2019;s art, its brevity a testament to the great elegance and wit of its composition.</p><p>Although, in the eyes of many, the law "moves slowly and sluggishly" behind society's advances, Lawrence M. Friedman, in <i>Law in America</i>, a historical overview from colonial times to the present, posits that this is an "illusion." As surely as culture creates law, law creates culture. The American legal system--a bubbling m�lange of common ("judge-made") and civil (derived from codes) law--is a "complicated beast," born of thousands of political entities. Originally a "crude and stripped down" descendant of English law, American law in the 19th century was often an instrument of "economic promotion." In the 20th century, with the rise of a national economy, an evermore heterogeneous population, waning federalism, and the rise of what Friedman calls the "administrative-welfare state," the law daily reached further, into the jurisdiction of civil rights of all stripes, product liability, malpractice, and environmental and antitrust considerations. Friedman's chapters on the colonial period and family law are strong, while his look at the contemporary legal climate drifts toward a general discussion of political and social mores. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>&#x201c;<b>Law in America</b> is a little gem. It is a peerless introduction to our legal history&#x2014;concise, clear, tellingly told, and beautifully written. The greatest living historian of American law has done it again.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Stanley N.

Embroidered textiles have been produced for thousands of years across North Africa and the Middle East to decorate public buildings, homes and animals as well as to clothe men, women and children. They have played an important role in the social and cultural lives of communities and peoples and have reflected the economic and political changes that have affected the region from the earliest times.</p><p>The <i>Encyclopedia of Embroidery from the Arab World</i> is the first reference work to chart the history of embroidery from Ancient Egypt to the present day and to offer an authoritative guide to all the major embroidery traditions of the region. It maps the diversity of embroidery from the Maghreb to the Gulf states, from Turkey to Sudan; traces the impact of trade, commerce, politics and religion on materials, colors, styles and fashions; introduces the embroiderers, their materials, equipment and techniques; and highlights the artistic and design influences of embroidery, through to its use by modern fashion designers. </p><p>Richly illustrated with 850 images (750 in colour) of clothes, accessories, cushions, bed linen, curtains, floor coverings and wall hangings, many of which have never been published before, the <i>Encyclopedia </i>is an essential resource for students and scholars of the subject.</p></p><p>This authoritative reference work explores the rich heritage of embroidery across the Arab world from antiquity to the present day.<b>Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood</b> is Director of the Textile Research Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.</p><h2>Common Core Progress English Language Arts Grade 7</h2><p>Common Core Progress provides instruction, scaffolded practice and assessment for the Common Core Standards</p><p></p><h2>The Sadeian Woman: And the Ideology of Pornography</h2><p>Draws on de Sade&#39;s embodiments of women&#39;s two roles, Justine and Juliette, and on more contemporary models to argue that sexuality is a mode of power politics as well as a vital way to advance relationships admitting of neither conqueror nor conquered.

Marked sometimes by the violent events of history&#x2015;first settlement, the Revolutionary War, and the Civil War&#x2015;and the explosive growth of the cotton economy, these towns and villages appear in the book as they developed across the South.</strong></p> The region divides naturally into four geographic areas, each one a stage along the path of settlement. The miles of shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico provided natural harbors for the first arrivals. Piedmont, at the foot of the mountains stretching from Virginia to Georgia, possessed the rich soil that made it the center of Southern agriculture. The profusion of rivers and the rich land along their banks attracted settlers from the Carolinas and Georgia, while the final push was to the deep interior and the mountains, the upcountry from the Blue Ridge chain in Virginia to the Texas hill country. The villages of these regions are varied, but those included in this book all have their individual beauty, whether expressed in white clapboard or Victorian brick.<br><br> Their historical variety, too, is expressed in their names, demonstrating the diversity of their origins. The name of Wascahachie, Texas, is derived from the Native American word for "buffalo creek." Waterford, Virginia, is unmistakably Irish, while Camden and York in South Carolina have a distinctly English ring. Whatever their origins, the villages and towns included in this book have one thing in common: their beauty. And this exquisite picture of the South is completed by special illustrated features on its horse culture, its churches and cemeteries, and its fabulous gardens.

But the Red Army still patrols the capital's rubble-strewn streets, and the ideals of the Revolution are but memories. Twenty-two-year-old Detective Emil Brod finally gets his chance to serve his country, investigating murder for the People's Militia. <br><br>The first victim is a state songwriter, but the facts point to a political motive.

Originally from Texas, he currently lives with his wife in Florence, Italy.<br>THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS (Chapter One)<p>The greeting was in his desk, the center drawer: a piece of fish-stained cardboard with a clumsily drawn stick figure. It had a circular head and an X for each eye. A fat knife separated the head from its stick body. The speech balloon said, We're on to you.</p><p>His chair wobbled insecurely beneath him.</p><p>Emil inhaled slowly, evenly. He sat in the center of the large, stale-smelling office, between two columns, and on the far wall two high, open windows did nothing to freshen the air. His tight suit constricted him as he stared above the others' heads at the clock on the yellow wall. It was the dirty, pale yellow of Austro-Hungarian demise. He had been here only forty-five minutes.</p><p>It was Monday, the twenty-third of August, 1948, 9:17 A.M. He still had a whole day to go.</p><p>He couldn't match names to their faces yet, but why should that matter? Along the walls, three of the four homicide inspectors grinned at their wide, steel desks, suppressing laughter. They were all to blame. Through the windows, street noises spilled into the hot room: clopping hooves, shouts, the occasional motor car.</p><p>His grandmother had starched his suit into a hard crust to celebrate his first day in the People's Militia. He wanted to run his finger between his collar and neck, but knew how it would look.</p><p>His exhale finally came.</p><p>The fourth inspector wasn't grinning: the stout one at the corner desk with the wide, flat, familiar-looking peasant's face. Despite the heat wave, he lounged in the leather overcoat of state security. By law, one security inspector was assigned to each Militia department, but no law ordered them to dress like that, like the Russian secret police. Yet they all did. And like their MVD counterparts, they never laughed. This one stared at Emil with the intensity of a scientist waiting for a nerve-provoked response.</p><p>In the opposite corner, beside the windows, the largest of them banged slowly at a typewriter. He was a neckless lump of clay with tin rings constricting his thick fingers. The sound of striking keys filled the room.</p><p>Emil had spoken to them once when he arrived. A twenty-two-year-old in a stiff suit with a stupid, bashful grin marking his pale features, a blond schoolboy among these dark veterans. "My name is Emil Brod, and this is my first day with Homicide."</p><p>A voice he could not put to a face had answered: "Desk's in the center."</p><p>Even then, they did not show him their eyes. But he was the only thing they were watching.</p><p>Emil settled his small hands on the desk.</p><p>At another time and place the sketched decapitation would have provoked violence. But now, here, he separated himself from the anger. He let the cardboard drop into his wastebasket, gingerly shifted the chair beneath himself, and opened the morning's Spark, which he had picked up on his way to work. There were grainy images of airplanes in the west, heavy American and British planes over Berlin. Words about remilitarization and effrontery spotted the pages, but he couldn't focus enough to read whole sentences. The typewriter continued snapping. The stuffy room grew hotter.</p><p>He had gone dutifully to the desk in the center of the room, just as the voice had commanded, and put down his hat and satchel. Then he rapped timidly on the door with CHIEF painted on the wood. A light curtain covered the dark window beside it. "When does Chief Moska arrive?"</p><p>It was an insignificant question, something he almost felt foolish asking, and their agreement was apparent by their silence. He returned to his desk. When he sat down his chair collapsed beneath him.</p><p>They had all laughed then, even the security inspector.</p><p>He sprang up. The chair was in pieces. The rope that bound its legs together had snapped, or been cut. Their amused faces turned back to their desks as he tied the chair together again with a fishing knot. It wobbled, but held. By the time he was finished, the laughter had been over a long time.</p><p>It was then that he had reached for the center drawer, if for no other reason than to look busy.</p><p>Maybe it was a joke. He didn't know. They had laughed, so perhaps there was nothing more to this than some gentle hazing. Like in the Academy, when they buried his papers in the middle of the firing range, or when he lay in the mud and they gave him one kick apiece. Certainly this was easier than that.</p><p>He set the newspaper aside. In one dusty corner was a brown porcelain heater for wintertime, as tall as a man, and along the walls three desks faced the center--faced him. The fourth desk, the state security inspector's, faced the wall.</p><p>He settled back into his creaking chair and affected a calm he didn't feel. He arranged the ink bottle on his desk and straightened the blotter, then placed his transfer papers--in triplicate, as required--along the edge. From his burlap satchel he brought out the cigars and the leather-bound notepad his grandfather had been able to unearth in the black market off Heroes' Square. If he focused on these little things he could make it.</p><p>The inspectors lounged at their desks, sweating, chewing dried pumpkin seeds, sometimes muttering into telephones, other times writing or smoking. The big one continued typing. Two of them--one scrawny and very dark, the other heavy and limping, spitting out flakes of pumpkin seed--met beside yellowed WANTED notices and joked quietly with one another. The sound of their laughter left small, cold spots in Emil's guts. They left the office together and returned smelling of clear alcohols. The fat one carried a fresh bag of tobacco with nicotine-yellowed fingers.</p><p>A man outside was shouting in Russian. Although the rowdy Russian soldiers that still occupied their small capital disturbed him as much as the next person, at that moment he wanted to be with them, under the sun, rather than in this dim, humid room with his own kind.</p><p>He stood without knowing why. Then, as he approached the massive typist, he knew. He would start with the largest, if only to instill faith in his courage. Emil rapped on the big man's desk beside an empty paper cup blackened by the morning's grounds. "Where do I get coffee around here?"</p><p>He stopped typing and looked at Emil's hand as though his finger were a cockroach. This close, the inspector's face was pocked and misshapen like a battlefield. "No coffee," he said flatly. He crushed the cup in his hand, then tossed it in his wastebasket.</p><p>Emil's collar tightened. He smiled involuntarily and stepped back to his desk. He could hear laughter somewhere. It was faint and distant beneath the hot buzzing of his blood. So was the glint of his polished shoes moving across the floor. He was a stiff clown among these wrinkled, dusty brutes. He remembered the Academy director's words: First District, Homicide. Desk's been open two years since some old poop named Sergei got himself shot after Liberation. They'll take anyone, Brod, why not you?</p><p>Why not, indeed.</p><p>The Spark was full of airplanes. It had been full of blockades and planes since June. Muddy newsprint airplanes on cheap, brittle pages, but they were clear enough. Allied airplanes over hills of rubble; airplanes over military convoys; airplanes over the hungry, defeated masses of a crushed Berlin, dropping parachutes with little boxes of food and chocolates and clothing. And--some reports said--guns.</p><p>The front page never changed, not even today. A part of him had expected to find the planes replaced by his own face--thin and pale, blond eyebrows almost invisible above his green eyes--beneath the headline: EMIL BROD MOVES INTO THE WORKING WORLD--NO MORE LESSONS FOR HIM! But there they still were, after weeks: airplanes: IMPERIAL UNDERHANDEDNESS IN BERLIN! Comrade Chairman Stalin called the institution of a new German currency a provocation. If the Allies had their way, a reborn, capitalist Germany would consume the workers of the world in fire. General Secretary Mihai, whose office was only a few streets away, reminded all citizens that their own country was small and young. It could easily be divided out of existence again by the republics around it. No one misunderstood his meaning. "Before the Great War, we were only a district of the Dual Monarchy--remember Versailles!" he told a reporter. "The others would claim we are theirs, but we are not pieces of the Ukraine and Czechoslovakia--we're neither Romania nor Hungary nor Poland! We are our own, indivisible nation!" Then: "Up with the Comrade Chairman!"</p><p>The second page listed upcoming trials. It was no longer like the days just after the Liberation, when the lists went on for many columns. But there were still some men and women accused of undermining the stability of their socialist state. There were a baker and three politicians and two tram drivers--which proved, according to a certain well-regarded Inspector Brano Sev, the democratic sensibility inherent in the instruments of criminal justice.</p><p>Around noon, he tried the smallest one. The wiry, dark inspector who sat beside the cold porcelain stove. He had a face that reminded Emil of the Jews who had appeared at the family dacha in Ruscova during the war. They had come in loose, hungry bands from over the Romanian border, muttering frantically about the Archangel Michael and their villages being burned to the ground. Their families, they said, had been chopped up by the Orthodox. This inspector had that same hungry, war-refugee look.</p><p>Emil spoke to him over the hand basins in the empty wash-room. His voice echoed unexpectedly against the tile walls. "How long does this go on?"</p><p>The inspector stopped splashing water over the back of his neck. He looked at Emil in the rusting mirror, hungry brow furrowing.</p><p>Beneath Emil's feet the decaying floor tiles wobbled. "The silence," he said, trying to make his voice sound light, conversational. "Is this what everyone goes through? I think I know how this works. Initiation?" He twisted his lips into a smile. "Or are you trying to scare me away?" He almost added jokingly that this situation hadn't come up in the Academy lessons, but thought better of it.</p><p>The inspector turned away, shook water off his hands and used a towel from a hook. His dark features gave away nothing, his eyes hard and small as he dried his neck. He gave Emil only a passing glance in the mirror as he hung up the towel again. Then he left. The creaking door echoed behind him.</p><p>They left the office singly and in pairs and did not return for hours. He assumed they were on cases. The Academy had taught two ways for a homicide inspector to receive a case. Either a switchboard operator sent a message to your telephone line, or the station chief emerged from his office and handed you one. All through the morning the phone on Emil's desk did not ring, and the chief was never in. He got coffee from a workers' caf� around the corner, returned, used the toilet twice, read the last pages of The Spark--all slowly, purposefully.</p><p>Around two o'clock, Chief Moska appeared in the doorway. He was another big man, in his fifties, who hiked up wrinkled, mud-spotted pants, rolled a cigarette in his lips, and took off his hat to mop damp, gray hair with a handkerchief. He stopped by desks and whispered to his men, and when they smiled Emil's stomach shriveled. These men were tight, had been for years. They had probably even fought the Germans together--side by side, without his help.</p><p>The chief stopped at Emil's desk and inclined his long, pale face. The smile was gone. He had the worn features of war veterans who believe they have witnessed everything this life could ever show them. "So you're the new one?" His voice was no longer a fraternal whisper; it was deep and swollen for all to hear.</p><p>"Yes, Comrade Chief Moska."</p><p>"Emil Brod from the Fourth District?"</p><p>"Fifth, Comrade Chief."</p><p>"Where did you serve in the Patriotic War?"</p><p>"I was too young, Com--"</p><p>"Too young my ass!" he bellowed. "You were born in 1926, which made you of age in--what?--1942, or at the latest '44." He eyeballed Emil's little hands on the desk. Emil removed them. "I have a neighbor who fought Germans when he was twelve. Remember who has your file, Brod."</p><p>Emil spoke with as much authority as he could muster. "What I meant to say was that when I came of age, I was not in the country. I was--"</p><p>"You were fishing in Finland!" the chief erupted, his sudden, broad smile revealing two holes where teeth should have been. "For little seals, no less!"</p><p>Their laughter was loud, bouncing off the walls.</p><p>"A Finnish company, yes," said Emil, recognizing a slight warble to his voice he hoped was only in his head. "But I hunted in the Arctic Circle."</p><p>For an instant he was out of this hot room and back in the icy north, among men so much more dangerous than these.</p><p>"You speak Russian, I hear."</p><p>"Yes. And German."</p><p>"A scholar," said the chief. "And now here you are, back at your mother's tit."</p><p>"In Homicide," Emil replied, his voice clearing up. "And I'm ready to work. Here are my transfer papers." He held out the folded pages.</p><p>The chief suddenly had the expression of a man about to retch. His nostrils, crisscrossed by a drinker's red tributaries, retracted. Then he stuffed the papers into his blazer pocket. "Well, Comrade Brod," he said through a heavy sigh, "don't make trouble. If you do that, trouble might stay away from you."</p><p>There were sprinkles of weak laughter from corners of the room Emil could not locate, because the blood pumping in his ears obscured their direction.</p><p>"I wouldn't consider it, Comrade Chief."</p><p>"And don't comrade me to death, Brod. Makes my skin crawl. Can you manage that simple task?"</p><p>"Yes, Chief."</p><p>They were all watching the exchange, their smiles fading in and out until the chief gave him one last miserable look, turned on his heel, and walked into his office. The door latched quietly.</p><p>Emil caught their amused faces as they turned away--the big typist, the refugee, the pumpkin-seed eater sweating in the back and the state security inspector with the peasant's features that clicked in Emil's skull, nagging at a memory that would not come.</p><p>First was the chair. Second, the drawing. Third was the homicide inspector with the face of a refugee who met him on the hot front steps at the end of that fruitless day. Down by the busy street, he smoked with some regular policemen standing in a semicircle around the head of a fly-nagged horse. Red-faced vendors sold wooden spoons and fabrics on the sidewalk, and a butcher hauled a bleating goose into his store. The policemen watched a pair of young women walk by, and hissed admiringly. When the embarrassed girls were no longer in sight, the inspector noticed Emil standing at the top of the steps. He patted the horse's nose, nodded at his friends, and began climbing toward him. The air was perfectly still.</p><p>Briefly, Emil felt a surge of the unreasonable hope that had buoyed him most of his life. It had brought him through the deaths of both his parents in the war and his months scraping out a living on the fishing boats of the frozen north. It had brought him through a brief love affair back here in the Capital, and the brutalities of the Academy. It had carried him all the way to these steps, where the concrete was remarkably bright after the gloom of the station. He sucked hot, wet air into his lungs, and blinked.</p><p>"Brod."</p><p>"Yes," said Emil, feeling the warmth of that hereditary hope. "Terzian, isn't it? Your name? Leonek Terzian?"</p><p>Leonek Terzian was two steps down, squinting up at him. "I wanted to tell you something," he said, his voice lacking anything Emil could call emotion.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Terzian glance...</p></p><h2>Medicinal Plants and Their History</h2><p><p>The history of plants and herbs in medicine is virtually the history of medicine itself. For thousands of years, they have played a fundamental role in the healing arts, right up to the present day. From the beginning, they were linked to the material of religion, were key factors in the cultural life of many societies, and became intertwined with magic. They remain today part of both the art and science of medicine. <i>Medicinal Plants and Their History</i> recounts the long and fascinating story of plants and herbal remedies &#x2014; the cultural traditions that used them, the books and treatises written about them, the tangential events that influenced them or were influenced by them.<br>From the ancient Chinese treatment for hay fever (recently proved to be scientifically sound) to today&#x2019;s sophisticated extraction of essential plant oils, the book details how various civilizations have used and misused plant remedies. Common practices of Egyptian, Indian, Hebraic, Greek, and Roman times are covered; as are those of the early Christian era, the Middle Ages, and sixteenth-, seventeenth-, eighteenth-, and nineteenth-century England. Coming into the twentieth century, there is a full description of modern cultivation of medicinal plants and the contemporary drug trade. The case of plants and herbs in magic and religion, the contributions of famous herbalists and physicians (notably Hippocrates, Pliny, Dioscorides, Sydenham), famous English and European herbals, medical organization and education in the Middle Ages, and the first British pharmacopoeia, are some of the related events described.<br>One of the most interesting and informative chapters is the one detailing the medicinal properties of 40 major orders of British wild plants &#x2014; over 150 plants in all. Whether the problem was fever, whooping cough, kidney trouble, or ague, there was a remedy for it. And, because many traditional remedies have a basis in scientific fact, you will discover which are still being used today.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>This Loving Land</h2><p>After the death of their mother Summer Kuykendall and her brother travel to Texas to live under the protection of Sam McLean, a family friend.

If so, what happened to the women who became full-fledged professional artists in earlier centuries? Why is the art of so many of them, though perhaps once famous, now forgotten?</p> <p>A survey of early Canadian women artists reveals a breadth of work that reflects the culture of this country in a multitude of images of the land and its people. At first the path taken by women artists ran parallel to the mainstream. By the early twentieth century, women artists came to play a significant role in the mainstream yet continued to offer a separate viewpoint.</p> <p>Does the difference between men and women affect the creative process? Women artists, like men, work within the context of their environment but take art somewhere we think we have seen before, but haven't. Broadly speaking, women artists have been particularly sympathetic to themes that reaffirm and dramatize the importance of life -- painting children, young women, and mothers and children. This subject matter would have been in keeping with their audience's expectations. At the same time, upon close examination of their artwork, we see that they often succeeded in breaking loose from what was considered appropriate to a woman's expression.</p> <p>The visual arts are one of the lasting achievements of humankind. Embodied in form and content and with a special relationship to the viewer, art manifests all the struggles and bounty this world has to offer. But to understand anything in its entirety, a dissection of parts is necessary. Whether we study the chronology of painting, the way in which each "ism" of art is interpreted, or the way in which artists select and portray their subject matter, knowing the basic properties enables us to see beyond the obvious in art.</p> <p>The beginnings of modern society are generally traced to the late eighteenth century when two kinds of revolution -- industrial and political -- began to transform the Western world. The Industrial Revolution, in particular, brought about economic change that redirected the priorities of the working class and specifically affected women. One of the immediate effects of the American and French Revolutions was the expansion of women's legal rights. Together, these revolutions set in motion a course that contributed to a greater acceptance of education for women, and this in turn led to new-found freedoms in intellectual life.</p> <p>Throughout the nineteenth century, working-class women found employment mostly as servants or within the garment industry. Industrialization did not dramatically influence the kinds of work that women performed, but by the mid-nineteenth century in Europe, social conditions had improved. The working day was shortened from twelve to ten hours. Although two hours may not significantly change a single day, cumulatively they allowed an increase in family and personal time as well as the pursuit of activities outside the home. These activities included participation in the larger community and the exploration of special interests and hobbies.</p> <p>By 1900, prosperity had reached more families and the separation between home and work was virtually complete. Women of privilege were able to partake in activities hitherto reserved for men. Access to education also became a reality for women of both the middle and upper classes; in time, the art academies of Europe felt a growing pressure to change their admission policies to allow female enrolment.</p> <p>European women who came to Canada, from the first settlers to immigrants in the early twentieth century, dealt first with the immediate challenges of life in a new land. They and their families risked their lives travelling across uncharted territory in the harshest of conditions until they found a place they could eventually call home. Communities had to be established before anyone could entertain the idea of artistic expression. The only creative work of the early settlers, with some notable exceptions, tended to be everyday items used on the homestead that were sewn or spun; these objects, some of which were works of art by today's standards, have by and large not been preserved.</p> <p>In Canada, primary education for girls became mandatory only after the 1880s. At this time in Europe, working-class families received virtually no education. Girls from merchant and aristocratic families received a rudimentary education either in religious schools or with private tutors. The focus of this education tended to reinforce a woman's role as a housekeeper rather than offering training in professional skills that might lead to financial independence. It is interesting to note that instruction in drawing and painting was part of a young woman's education at this time; it was considered an appropriate and amusing pastime yet was frowned upon as a professional calling.</p> <p>Advances in technology and transportation near the end of the nineteenth century allowed greater flexibility of movement. By 1880, trans-Atlantic shipping lines such as Allan, Beaver, and Dominion were established to facilitate travel to Europe. At the same time, social conventions that governed the lives of women of a certain class, such as the idea that an escort was required for any engagement outside the home, had come to seem pointless and unnecessary. As a result, during the 1890s in Canada, numerous daring individuals of the female sex took the newly available opportunities to expand their horizons and enrolled in schools abroad.</p> <p>The academies of Paris and London offered training far superior to that which could be obtained in Canada. Art students benefited from access to the finest art galleries and museums in the world; they could join the lively communities of artists; and the picturesque countryside was nearby for sketching trips. Among those who ventured to Europe to study art, we must count many of the women mentioned in this text, most notably Florence Carlyle, Emily Carr, Laura Muntz Lyall, and Helen McNicoll.</p> <p>Predictably, the path to this new training was lined with thorns. Private ateliers were more inclined to take female students but charged a higher rate for them than for male students, thus making attendance a privilege only for the wealthy or those lucky few who were assisted by relatives. Still, more and more women signed up. In 1801, only twenty-eight women artists exhibited in the Paris Salon. By 1878, that number had grown to 762, and by the year 1900, over one thousand of the exhibitors were women.</p> <p>In Canada, Maritime and Prairie women took the lead in organizing schools of art. In 1887, Anna Leonowens founded Halifax's Victoria School of Art and Design, today's Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Mary Ewart was instrumental in founding the Winnipeg School of Art at the beginning of the twentieth century. Mary Dignam was responsible for organizing the Woman's Art Association of Canada (today, the Women's Art Association) in Toronto in 1890; it was a group that grew quickly and soon had functioning branches from Winnipeg to Saint John.</p> <p>Although women's participation in art schools increased markedly in the late nineteenth century, they still found they had to struggle alone and pay dearly for their survival. The opportunity to study the nude model was restricted for women, as was instruction in anatomy: women students drew from engravings and casts of torsos. Many of the art associations allowed women members, but prohibited their participation in decision-making. By not being allowed participation in forums on art, women could not exercise self-definition as easily as men. They could not easily partake in art movements or develop their ideas into metaphors for historians to study and write about. Above all, they could not achieve the public presence afforded their male counterparts. As a result, independent clubs surfaced for women only; while they addressed some of the crucial issues facing the female artist, such groups tended to act as buffers, further insulating women from the general course of art.</p> <p>Despite the growing involvement</p></p><h2>The Crossing of Antarctica: Original Photographs from the Epic Journey That Fulfilled Shackleton&#39;s Dream</h2><p><p><strong>One hundred years after Shackleton attempted to cross the great white continent of Antarctica, this beautifully illustrated volume celebrates the men who succeeded where he had failed . . . and rewrote the history books</strong></p> The year 2014 is the centenary of Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x2019;s <em>Endurance</em> expedition, which aimed to complete the first crossing of Antarctica.

The last, informal section of <i>Due Considerations</i> assembles more or less autobiographical pieces&#x2014;reminiscences, friendly forewords, comments on the author&#x2019;s own recent works, responses to probing questions.<br><br>In between, many books are considered, some in introductions&#x2014;to such classics as <i>Walden, The Portrait of a Lady, </i>and <i>The Mabinogion</i>&#x2014;and many more in reviews, usually for <i>The New Yorker</i>. Ralph Waldo Emerson and the five Biblical books of Moses come in for appraisal, along with <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin </i>and<i> The Wizard of Oz</i>. Contemporary American and English writers&#x2014;Colson Whitehead, E. L. Doctorow, Don DeLillo, Norman Rush, William Trevor, A. S.

In factual waters, Mr. Updike ponders the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> and the &#x201c;unsinkable career&#x201d; of Coco Chanel, the adventures of Lord Byron and Iris Murdoch, the sexual revolution and the advent of female Biblical scholars, and biographies of Robert Frost, Sinclair Lewis, Marcel Proust, and S�ren Kierkegaard.<br><br>Reading <i>Due Considerations</i> is like taking a cruise that calls at many ports with a witty, sensitive, and articulate guide aboard&#x2014;a voyage not to be missed.</p><p>John Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954, and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <i>The New Yorker,</i> and since 1957 has lived in Massachusetts. He is the father of four children and the author of more than fifty books, including collections of short stories, poems, essays, and criticism. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize (twice), the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal. A previous collection of essays, <i>Hugging the Shore,</i> received the 1983 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism.<b>Chapter One: Everything ConsideredOn Literary Biography</b>(A talk given on November 13, 1998, at the University of South Carolina, in Columbia, in honor of the two hundredth volume produced by the <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i>. A less discursive version appeared in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, January 21, 1999.)<i>There never was a good biography of a good novelist. There couldn&#x2019;t be. He is too many people, if he&#x2019;s any good.</i>&#x2013;F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his notebooks<i>Poets don&#x2019;t have biographies. Their work is their biography.</i>&#x2013;Octavio Paz, &#x201c;A Note to Himself&#x201d;The main question concerning literary biography is, surely, Why do we need it at all? When an author has devoted his life to expressing himself, and, if a poet or a writer of fiction, has used the sensations and critical events of his life as his basic material, what of significance can a biographer add to the record? Most writers lead quiet lives or, even if they don&#x2019;t, are of interest to us because of the words they set down in what had to have been quiet moments. Regardless of what fascinated his contemporaries, Byron interests us now because of <i>Don Juan</i> and those other poems that still sing, and, secondarily, because of his dashing, spirited letters. His physical beauty, his poignant limp, the scandalous collapse of his marriage and his flight from England as a social outcast, his picturesque European dissipations, his generous involvement in the cause of Greek independence, and his tragically youthful death at Missolonghi in 1824&#x2013;all this sensational stuff would be buried in the mustiest archives of history did not Byron&#x2019;s literary achievement distinguish him from the scores of similarly vexed and dynamic men of this turbulent Romantic era. By his words he still lives, and they give the impetus to the periodic biographies of which last year&#x2019;s, by Phyllis Grosskurth, will soon be followed, next year, by Benita Eisler&#x2019;s.[1]I am not an especial devotee of literary biography. Indeed, I have my reasons to distrust it. Yet, looking back, I see that I have reviewed a fair amount of it, and, in addition, have read an amount on my own initiative, to satisfy my own curiosity. Although one rarely sees literary biography on the best-seller list,[2] a prodigious amount of it is produced, some of it at prodigious length. The estimable British biographer Michael Holroyd topped his two-volume biography of Lytton Strachey with a three-volume biography of George Bernard Shaw. Leon Edel&#x2019;s biography of Henry James took twenty-one years in the writing and occupies five volumes, of which the last is the bulkiest. In my barn I keep those books which, arriving free at the house, I deem too precious and potentially useful to give to the local church fair, and yet not so valuable as to win space on the packed shelves within my book-burdened domicile. Venturing out to my slapdash barn shelves, I note works of roughly five hundred pages on Edmund Wilson, Simone Weil, and Joyce Cary; six-hundred-page tomes on Oscar Wilde and Ivy Compton-Burnett; six hundred and fifty pages on Norman Mailer; seven hundred each on Jean Genet and Samuel Beckett; an eight- hundred-page work on Zola; and, the heavyweight champion in this vicinity, twelve hundred pages on the not notably prolific James Thurber. Length of life bears some relation to length of book; in the department of doomed poets, Sylvia Plath, dead at thirty, received three hundred fifty pages of attention, whereas Anne Sexton, who lived to be forty-six, one hundred more. However, Delmore Schwartz had the fifty-three years of his life compressed into a mere four hundred pages, as did the drink-raddled but surprisingly long-lived Dorothy Parker. And these are just the tenants in my barn.My opening question&#x2013;<i>Why do we need it at all?</i>&#x2013;focuses us on the motives of the consumers, not the producers. Some literary biographies begin as Ph.D. theses; others as the personal accounts of a friend or acquaintance of the author. In general, people write books because they think they have some light to shed and because they aspire to the rewards and satisfactions of having written a book. We <i>read</i>, those of us who do, literary biographies for a variety of reasons, of which the first and perhaps the most worthy is the desire to prolong and extend our intimacy with the author&#x2013;to partake again, from another angle, of the joys we have experienced within the author&#x2019;s oeuvre, in the presence of a voice and mind we have come to love.An example of such a prolongation is George D. Painter&#x2019;s two-volume biography of Marcel Proust, which I read as a young man not long emerged from the full stretch of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, intoxicated and thirsty for more. Painter&#x2019;s biography, unprecedented in its attempt to treat Proust&#x2019;s life with definitive completeness, allows us to enter the vast mansion of the novel by a back door, as it were, an approach that turns solid and hard and definite what in the novel was large and vague and inconsecutively arranged and beautifully charged with Proust&#x2019;s poetic sensibility. Painter must use research and investigation to build what Proust constructed out of his memory, but it is recognizably the same edifice, with some practical additions. Painter restores great omissions, such as the writer&#x2019;s younger brother Robert, and is frank and analytic where Proust was evasive, as in the matter of his narrator&#x2019;s sexual preference. The enchanted Combray, where little Marcel is fed a tea-soaked madeleine by his Aunt L�onie and waits with desperate longing for the bell on the garden gate to signify that Monsieur Swann has left and his mother is free to come upstairs and give her son a good-night kiss&#x2013;Combray becomes Illiers, a town on the map, not far from Chartres, with a distinct history, cartography, and set of houses. Aunt L�onie, we are told, was based, almost without modification, on Proust&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s sister Elizabeth Amiot; her house still stands, and Painter describes little Marcel&#x2019;s bedroom with some of Proust&#x2019;s words but in an altogether more factual accent: &#x201c;His bed was screened by high white curtains, and covered in the daytime with flowered quilts, embroidered counterpanes and cambric pillowcases which he had to remove and drape over a chair, &#x2018;where they consented to spend the night,&#x2019; before he could go to bed. On a bedside table stood a blue glass tumbler and sugar-basin, with a water-jug to match, which his aunt always told Ernestine to empty on the day after his arrival, &#x2018;because the child might spill it.&#x2019; On the mantelpiece was a clock muttering under a glass bell, so heavy that whenever the clock ran down they had to send for the clockmaker to wind it again; on the armchairs were little white antimacassars crocheted with roses, &#x2018;not without thorns,&#x2019; since they stuck to him whenever he sat down . . .&#x201d; and so on, in a strange but pleasing transposition of the Proustian world into our own. The schematic principle of the two &#x201c;ways&#x201d; whereby Proust organized his narrator&#x2019;s massive pilgrimage is sharply brought down to earth. Painter writes:&#x201c;To the child Marcel the two favourite walks of the family seemed to be in diametrically opposite directions, so that no two points in the world could be so utterly separated as their never-reached destinations. Whether they left the house by the front door or by the garden-gate, they would turn one way for M�r�glise and the other way for Saint-Eman. . . . In his novel Proust called M�r�glise &#x201c;M�s�glise,&#x201d; for euphony; and as the way there went by the Pr� Catalan, which he had transformed into Swann&#x2019;s park, he was able to say with truth that it was also Swann&#x2019;s Way.&#x201d;The biography becomes, then, a way of re-experiencing the novel, with a closeness, and a delight in seeing imagined details conjured back into real ones, that only this particular writer and his vast autobiographical masterpiece could provide. Lovers of Proust will be inevitably drawn to Painter because it is more of the same, mirrored back into reality. Richard Ellmann&#x2019;s superb biography of James Joyce, though also dealing with a concentrated and highly personal oeuvre, cannot quite offer us such a mirroring, though its chapter epigraphs, ingeniously chosen quotations from Joyce, make glittering reflective shards. We read Ellmann not only to revisit Joyce&#x2019;s Dublin but to understand how Joyce, modernism&#x2019;s wonder-worker, did it&#x2013;how did he produce from the drab facts of the provincial, sodden, priest-ridden Irish capital such rare and comprehensive art as is contained in <i>Dubliners</i>, <i>Portrait of the Artist</i>, <i>Ulysses</i>, and <i>Finnegans Wake</i>? What I remember from my reading, years ago, in Ellmann&#x2019;s eight hundred pages is that <i>Ulysses</i> first came to Joyce as a short story, one more sketch of a Dubliner, and that during its seven-year composition, even to within a few weeks of its publication day, the author in his European exile pestered his relatives and friends back in Dublin for local details. He wrote his aunt Josephine Murray, concerning the Powells and the Dillons, models for Molly Bloom&#x2019;s family: &#x201c;Get an ordinary sheet of foolscap and scribble any God damn drivel you may remember about these people.&#x201d; He asked her such relentlessly circumstantial questions as &#x201c;Is it possible for an ordinary person to climb over the area railings of no 7 Eccles Street, either from the path or the steps, lower himself from the lowest part of the railings till his feet are within 2 feet or 3 of the ground and drop unhurt.&#x201d; <i>Ulysses</i>, confronting the banality of modern life, compels quantities of drivel into a Thomistically schematic mold that parodies the incidents of the <i>Odyssey</i>; an excess of matter is heroically matched by an excess of form.Perhaps only writers are interested in the details of craft, and how others manage the cunning dishevelment of composition. But of literary biographies I tend to remember curious methodological details: Ivy Compton-Burnett wrote sitting at one end of a sofa and stored the accumulating composition under a sofa cushion; Edith Wharton wrote in bed and threw her pages on the floor for a secretary to pick up and transcribe; Joyce Cary worked at whatever scene of a novel came to him and trusted them to all tie up at the end; Hemingway wrote with freshly sharpened pencils while standing at a tall desk; Nabokov wrote on three-by-five index cards; John Keats would put on his best clothes before sitting down to write a poem; Henry James, after he suffered an attack of writer&#x2019;s cramp, began to dictate to a typist, and his later style was born in the dutiful transcription of his spoken longueurs, qualifications, and colloquialisms.The question <i>How did he or she do it?</i> takes, in the case of William Shakespeare, the more drastic form <i>Did he do it?</i> A few years ago I went out and&#x2013;always a reluctant move for a writer&#x2013;purchased a book, Dennis Kay&#x2019;s 1992 biography of Shakespeare. I was interested to see what a modern scholar could assemble of evidence regarding the historical identity of the greatest writer in English. I was persuaded, as I had expected to be, that the son of a small-town burgess and high bailiff, an eldest son presumably educated in the strenuous Latin curriculum of the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, and evidently enlisted in a shotgun marriage at the tender age of eighteen, might go to London and become an actor and playwright and, in a career little more than twenty years long, write the greatest plays and some of the greatest poetry in the language. Unlike certain devotees of the nobility, I have never had any problem with the idea that a child of the middling provincial gentry (Shakespeare&#x2019;s mother was an Arden, a family of prosperous farmers) might enter the theatrical profession and spin a literary universe out of his dramatic flair, opportune learning, and country-bred street-smarts. Robert Greene&#x2019;s famous calumny, of &#x201c;an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers,&#x201d; who &#x201c;supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you,&#x201d; fits the case perfectly. Shabby gentility has ever been the cradle of upstart writers. Nevertheless, there is a worrisome disproportion between the meagre verifiable biographical facts and the tremendous literary events associated with Shakespeare&#x2019;s name. Something of the same disproportion affects the case of Jane Austen, another exalted literary performer about whom we seem to know too little, so that the recent biography by Claire Tomalin must pad its substance with a wealth of detail about the general period in which Austen lived.Literary biography in all cases runs up against this limit of determinism: there is no clear reason why one secluded clergyman&#x2019;s daughter should have been a literary genius while hundreds of others were not. Certain generalizations might be made, in retrospect, about the flowering of, say, Elizabethan poetry or Greek drama or the Russian novel, but the appearance of a great individual remains an indeterminate matter of microcosmic luck and will. The cultural situation at the turn of the last century might be said to have been sickly; but Yeats and Proust and Joyce all took their beginnings in it. To quote an old couplet of my own:&#x201c;<i>Fin-de-si�cle</i> sickliness becameHigh-stepping Modernism, then went lame.&#x201d;We read literary biography, often, in a diagnostic mood, as if dealing with a ward of sick men and women. Psychoanalytical theories of compensation and Edmund Wilson&#x2019;s moving essay &#x201c;The Wound and the Bow&#x201d; have alerted biographers to the relation of creative drive to human disabilities. Any biographer of Kafka must deal, for example, with his insomnia, his unnatural awe of his father, his ambivalence toward his own Jewishness, and his inability, until fatally weakened by tuberculosis, to achieve a liaison with a woman&#x2013;the entire psychological paralysis, in short, dramatized in his grave comedies of modern bafflement. Our mid-nineteenth-century giants Melville and Hawthorne, linked by an uneasy friendship, challenge any biographer with the mysteries of their affective lives. Melville&#x2019;s mental fragility, his homoerotic vein, his inadequacies as a husband and a father hardly fit with the humor and vigor of his best creations and the toughness that saw him through a longish life loaded with disappointments. And Hawthorne, who spent the years of his youth haunting Salem, writing in an attic, walking out mostly at dusk, chiefly consorting with an eccentrically shy mother and a strong- minded sister who was, it has been speculated, a virtual wife to him&#x2013; how does this strangeness feed into the strangeness of his work, lending it a shadowy intensity and an evasive reliance upon whimsy and the play of fancy? The vocabularies of psychoanalysis and of literary analysis become increasingly entwined; though we must not forget that these invalids receive our attention because of the truth and poetry and entertainment to be found in their creations. A wound existed, but also a strong bow, and a target was struck.NOTES[1] See pp. 504-14.[2] &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t sell,&#x201d; my friend the poet and book editor Peter Davidson has flatly reassured me.</p><h2>All Quiet on the Western Front : With Related Readings</h2><p>A young German soldier of World War I tells of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Gameplayers of Zan</h2><p>The ler had been genetically created to be a new race of supermen, and the experiment had not been entirely successful.

The Great War Illustrated 1916 is the third picture volume in this series that deals exclusively with actions fought throughout the year on the Western Front.<br><br>Split into five chapters, the authors begin with the British defeat at Kut, showing photographs from British and Turkish perspectives throughout the four-month campaign. The second chapter explores the new technological advances made by both sides throughout the year including new tanks, aircraft and guns. Photographs show the new equipment in action on the battlefield as well as being manufactured on production lines in the factories back home. We then turn to the Battle of Verdun, one of the largest battles of the First World War, before exploring the Battle of Jutland. Being the only full-scale naval clash of the entire First World War, the two-day battle saw twenty-five ships sunk and over 8,000 men killed on both sides and the authors analyse the battle in full detail, illustrating the ships that were involved and the men who sailed upon them. The concluding chapter explores the infamous Battle of the Somme, from the horrendous losses suffered on 1 July to the arduous battle of attrition that followed thereafter. Split into sub-sections, detailed analysis of the Australians, Canadians and British troops are featured along with a final section showing winter conditions in the area at the end of the year.<br><br>With over 1,300 painstakingly enhanced and restored photographs and a thirty-two page full colour section, the work within these pages represents a real labour of love and offers the reader an exceptional picture library of rare and unseen pictures that is easily accessible for the general reader and military enthusiast alike.</p><p>The author has been employed in printing and publishing for fifty years.

Success is thus not a destination but a journey, from station to station. He lists the main reasons for unhappiness as a guilty conscience, self-pity, envy, selfishness, timidity, worry and the absence of a spiritual consciousness. He discusses the role of the subconscious mind and how it is activated by enthusiasm and explains how the subconscious follows the pattern established by the conscious mind. He throws light on the difference between potential and kinetic energy and the law of cause and effect and emphasizes that one must visualize in order to materialize.

What must we do to recover possession of our true selves? By way of an answer, Merton discusses how we have become strangers to ourselves by our depence on outward identity and success, while our real need is for a concern with the image of God in ourselves. At a time of retrieval of our religious traditions, Merton's voice is both intelligent and spiritually compelling.Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, is perhaps the foremost spiritual thinker of the twentiethcentury.

Though he lived a mostly solitary existence as a Trappist monk, he had a dynamic impact on world affairs through his writing. An outspoken proponent of the antiwar and civil rights movements, he was both hailed as a prophet and castigated for his social criticism. He was also unique among religious leaders in his embrace of Eastern mysticism, positing it as complementary to the Western sacred tradition. Merton is the author of over forty books of poetry, essays, and religious writing, including <i>Mystics and Zen Masters</i>, and <i>The Seven Story Mountain</i>, for which he is best known.

For millennia we existed within a religious and psychological framework that honored the Earth as a partner and worked to maintain a balance with nature. But somehow a root pathology took hold in Western civilization--the idea of domination over nature--and this led to an alienation of the human spirit that has allowed an unprecedented destruction of the very systems which support that spirit. <br><br>In <i>Green Psychology</i> Ralph Metzner explores the history of this global pathology and examines the ways that we can restore a healing relationship with nature. His search for role models takes him from shamanic ceremonies with the Lacandon Maya of Mexico to vision quests in the California desert, from the astonishing nature mysticism of Hildegard von Bingen to the Black Goddesses and Green Gods of our pagan ancestors. He examines the historical roots of the split between humans and nature, showing how first sky-god worshiping cultures, then monotheisms, and finally mechanistic science continued to isolate the human psyche from the life-giving Earth. His final chapters present a solution, showing that disciplines such as deep ecology and ecofeminism are creating a worldview in which the mind of humanity and the health of the Earth are harmoniously intertwined.</p><p>If we could name the greatest environmental threat that we face, it wouldn't be the depletion of the ozone or even of the world's natural resources. In fact, it would be the depletion of the human spirit, according to ecopsychologist Ralph Metzner, Ph.D. And how did this catastrophe come about? It all happened when the religions of Western civilization were no longer based on living harmoniously with the earth. Once Western religions began to seek dominance instead of partnership with nature, we created a pathology that led to a massive destruction of the human spirit and a frightening worship of consumerism to fill the void. Simply put, by disrespecting and destroying the earth, we are disrespecting and destroying what sustains the human spirit, explains Metzner.<p> Although the perils of disconnecting from nature are well written and researched, this is not a book of doom and gloom. In fact, Metzner has accomplished an extremely well-written and thoroughly hopeful book. The final chapters suggest numerous solutions. Metzner also points to encouraging signs, such as the new wave of ecofeminism, as evidence of our ability to return to the earth--once again bonding spirit with nature. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Ralph Metzner, Ph.D., has been exploring states of consciousness and transformational practices ever since he helped found the Harvard Psilocybin Project in 1960.

As she struggles with her grandmother's aging, her sister's mental illness, and her own epilepsy, she realizes they might need more than she can give.<br>When Jane Forrester takes a position as Grace County's newest social worker, she is given the task of recommending which of her clients should be sterilized without their knowledge or consent. The state's rationalization is that if her clients are poor, or ill, or deemed in some way "unfit" they should not be allowed to have children. But soon Jane becomes emotionally invested in her clients' lives, causing tension with her new husband and her supervisors. No one understands why Jane would want to become a caseworker for the Department of Public Health when she could be a housewife and Junior League member. As Jane is drawn in by the Hart women, she begins to discover the secrets of the small farm&#x2015;secrets much darker than she would have guessed. Soon, she must decide whether to take drastic action to help them, or risk losing a life-changing battle.<br><i></i><br><i>Necessary Lies</i> is the story of these two young women, seemingly worlds apart, but both haunted by tragedy.

I hadn&#x2019;t expected the house to be so large. It stood apart from its neighbors on the gently winding road, flanked on either side by huge magnolia trees, tall oaks, and crape myrtle. It was painted a soft buttery yellow with white trim, and everything about it looked crisp and clean in the early morning sun. Every house I&#x2019;d passed, although different in architecture, had the same stately yet inviting look. I didn&#x2019;t know Raleigh well at all, but this had to be one of the most beautiful old neighborhoods in the city. <br>I parked close to the curb and headed up the walk. Potted plants lined either side of the broad steps that led up to the wraparound porch. I glanced at my watch. I had an hour before I needed to be back at the hotel. No rush, though my nerves were really acting up. There was so much I hoped would go well today, and so much of it was out of my control. <br>I rang the bell and heard it chime inside the house. I could see someone pass behind the sidelight and then the door opened. The woman&#x2014;forty, maybe? At least ten years younger than me&#x2014;smiled, although that didn&#x2019;t mask her harried expression. I felt bad for bothering her this early. She wore white shorts, a pink striped T-shirt, and tennis shoes, and sported a glowing tan. She was the petite, toned, and well-put-together sort of woman that always made me feel sloppy, even though I knew I looked fine in my black pants and blue blouse. <br>&#x201c;Brenna?&#x201d; She ran her fingers through her short-short, spiky blond hair. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And you must be Jennifer.&#x201d; <br>Jennifer peered behind me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not with you?&#x201d; she asked. <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;I thought she&#x2019;d come, but at the last minute she said she just couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>Jennifer nodded. &#x201c;Today must be really hard for her.&#x201d; She took a step back from the doorway. &#x201c;Come on in,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My kids are done with school for the summer, but they have swim-team practice this morning, so we&#x2019;re in luck. We have the house to ourselves. The kids are always too full of questions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; I walked past her into the foyer. I was glad no one else was home. I wished I had the house totally to myself, to be honest. I would have loved to explore it. But that wasn&#x2019;t why I was here. <br>&#x201c;Can I get you anything?&#x201d; Jennifer asked. &#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m good, thanks.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, come on then. I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; <br>She led me to the broad, winding staircase and we climbed it without speaking, my shoes on the shiny dark hardwood treads making the only sound. <br>&#x201c;How long have you been in the house?&#x201d; I asked when we reached the second story. <br>&#x201c;Five years,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We redid everything. I mean, we painted every single room and every inch of molding. And every closet, too, except for that one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you paint that one?&#x201d; I asked as I followed her down a short hallway. <br>&#x201c;The woman we bought the house from specifically told us not to. She said that the couple <i>she&#x2019;d</i> bought the house from had also told her not to, but nobody seemed to understand why not. The woman we bought it from showed us the writing. My husband thought we should just paint over it&#x2014;I think he was spooked by it&#x2014;but I talked him out of it. It&#x2019;s a <i>closet.</i> What would it hurt to leave it unpainted?&#x201d; We&#x2019;d reached the closed door at the end of the hall. &#x201c;I had no idea what it meant until I spoke to you on the phone.&#x201d; She pushed open the door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my daughter&#x2019;s room now,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;so excuse the mess.&#x201d; <br>It wasn&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;d call messy at all. My twin daughters&#x2019; rooms had been far worse. &#x201c;How old&#x2019;s your daughter?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Ten. Thus the Justin Bieber obsession.&#x201d; She swept her arm through the air to take in the lavender room and its nearly wall-to-wall posters. <br>&#x201c;It only gets worse.&#x201d; I smiled. &#x201c;I barely survived my girls&#x2019; teen years.&#x201d; I thought of my family&#x2014;my husband and my daughters and their babies&#x2014;up in Maryland and suddenly missed them. I hoped I&#x2019;d be home by the weekend, when all of this would be over. <br>Jennifer opened the closet door. It was a small closet, the type you&#x2019;d find in these older homes, and it was crammed with clothes on hangers and shoes helter-skelter on the floor. I felt a chill, as though a ghost had slipped past me into the room. I hugged my arms as Jennifer pulled a cord to turn on the light. She pressed the clothes to one side of the closet. <br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; she said, pointing to the left wall at about the level of my knees. &#x201c;Maybe we need a flashlight?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Or I can just take a bunch of these clothes out. I should have done that before you got here.&#x201d; She lifted an armload of the clothes and struggled to disengage the hangers before carrying them from the closet. Without the clothing, the closet filled with light and I squatted inside the tight space, pushing pink sneakers and a pair of sandals out of my way. <br>I ran my fingers over the words carved into the wall. Ancient paint snagged my fingertips where it had chipped away around the letters. <i>&#x201c;Ivy and Mary was here.&#x201d;</i> All at once, I felt overwhelmed by the fear they must have felt back then, and by their courage. When I stood up, I was brushing tears from my eyes. <br>Jennifer touched my arm. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful to you for not covering that over. It makes it real to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If we ever move out of this house, we&#x2019;ll tell the new owners to leave it alone, too. It&#x2019;s a little bit of history, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br>I nodded. I remembered my phone in my purse. &#x201c;May I take a picture of it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course!&#x201d; Jennifer said, then added with a laugh, &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t get my daughter&#x2019;s messy closet in it.&#x201d; <br>I pulled out my phone and knelt down near the writing on the wall. I snapped the picture and felt the presence of a ghost again, but this time it wrapped around me like an embrace. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Diane Chamberlain Books, Inc. <br></p><h2>Homes in the Heartland: Balloon Frame Farmhouses of the Upper Midwest (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage)</h2><p><p>Available for the first time in paperback and with a new preface, Homes in the Heartland offers a captivating explanation of the revolutionary balloon frame house construction that swept across Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin from 1850 to 1920, enabling the settlers of the upper Midwest to build affordable permanent structures in which to establish frontier homes. </p><p>Featuring more than 150 illustrations, including photographs and house plans, Fred W.

I blink several times, attempting to focus.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no warning, no explanation. I can&#x2019;t hear the car from here. I just open my eyes and see the green lights. It&#x2019;s like they appeared out of nowhere, shaking me from my daze. They are brighter than most headlights, glaring from between the two dead trees at the end of the lane.

New York Times best-selling author, Robert Spencer, of more than a dozen books dealing with Islam and the West, warns Christians against the danger of thinking that Islam is an easy ally and shines the light of truth on areas where Christians and Muslims don t just quibble over small details but fundamentally disagree. Many Christian groups, including the Catholic Church, do recognize whatever is good and true in Islam, and their leaders rightly pursue peaceful accord and common ground with all religions. Spencer argues, however, that real peace can come only from truth. Where there is falsehood in Islamic doctrine, morals, and practice, papering over the truth actually hurts the cause of peace. He demonstrates how these differences are not academic but real-world. They are critical and drive Muslim behavior toward Christians and others. If we fail to open our eyes to these differences, we do so at our peril.</p><p>Some Christians view Islam as a sister religion, a branch of the same Abrahamic tree lacking the fullness of revelation but nonetheless a religion of peace.

Where there is falsehood in Islamic doctrine, morals, and practice, papering over the truth actually hurts the cause of peace.</p><p> And so Spencer, the New York Times best-selling author of more than a dozen books dealing with Islam and the West, shines the light of truth on areas where Christians and Muslims don't just quibble over small details but fundamentally disagree, including: </p><p> The character of God, Jesus, and divine revelation</p><p> The nature of truth and the source of moral law</p><p> Religious freedom and other basic human rights</p><p> Life issues, marriage, and sexual morality</p><p> The rights and dignity of women</p><p> He demonstrates how these differences are not academic but real-world. They are critical and drive Muslim behavior toward Christians and others. If we fail to open our eyes to these differences, we do so at our peril.</p>Robert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch , a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the author of twelve books, including two New York Times bestsellers, The Truth about Muhammad and The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades). Spencer, a Melkite Greek Catholic, has led seminars on Islam and jihad for the United States Central Command, United States Army Command and General Staff College, the U.S. Army s Asymmetric Warfare Group, the FBI, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the U.S. intelligence community.</p><h2>Class with the Countess: How to Live with Elegance and Flair</h2><p>Provides advice on etiquette and modern social graces, covering the art of being oneself in any situation, ways to make other people comfortable, and the art of seduction.</p><p>Countess Luann de Lesseps is one of the six stars of Bravo&#x2019;s hit reality show &#x201c;The Real Housewives of New York City&#x201d; and has taught etiquette on numerous morning television shows. She lives with her family in New York, the Hamptons, and Gstaad.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p><br>How Does a Countess Come to Be on Reality TV?</p><p></p><p>Since the first season of&nbsp;<i>The Real Housewives of New York City</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;began to air, I have been deluged with e-mails and letters asking my advice on everything from what to wear to knowing what to say, from table manners to how to radiate self-confidence. Little did I expect the response my appearance on the show would generate. It became obvious that people are confused about what is appropriate in a world in which anything goes, and fans were turning to me for advice. People seem just as eager to know my story, especially how I became a countess, and are curious about what being an aristocrat means today. I decided to address all of the many questions I have received by combining my story, the life lessons I have learned along the way, and my distinctive advice on how to navigate our sometimes rude world with elegance, by writing&nbsp;<i>Class with the Countess</i>.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, one of the first questions people ask is why I agreed to take a role in the show.</p><p></p><p>Though you might not expect a countess to participate in a reality show, the decision to appear on&nbsp;<i>Real Housewives of New York City</i>&nbsp;came easily to me. I have always been daring and adventurous, as you will soon see.</p><p>When I received an e-mail from my friend Jill Zarin, offering to talk to me about appearing on a show to be called<i>Manhattan Moms</i>, I was definitely curious. But let me start at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>I met Jill Zarin at the after-party of a screening of Michael Moore&#x2019;s movie&nbsp;<i>Sicko</i>&nbsp;that I had attended with my niece Coryn. At one point, I looked over to see my niece talking with an older gentleman. I joined them and learned that Bobby Zarin had invited Coryn to the Zarins&#x2019; Fourth of July party so that his son could meet her. We had a lively conversation, and Jill Zarin joined us. We really hit it off, and our paths continued to cross. That&#x2019;s how it is in New York&#x2014;it can feel like a small town sometimes.</p><p></p><p>My family went off to Europe for a few weeks. While our children attended camp in Switzerland, my husband and I vacationed with our friends Sebastian and Elizabeth in the South of France. The day we returned, I found the e-mail from Jill about the show. I took the leap and met with the producers.</p></p><h2>Mary Coin</h2><p><b>*An NPR Best Book of 2013</b>*<br><b>*A BBC Best Book of 2013* </b><br>&nbsp;<p>In her first novel since <i>The God of War,</i> the critically acclaimed author Marisa Silver takes Dorothea Lange&#x2019;s &#x201c;Migrant Mother&#x201d; photograph as inspiration for a breathtaking reinvention&#x2014;a story of two women, one famous and one forgotten, and of the remarkable legacy of their chance encounter.<br><br>In 1936, a young mother resting by the side of a road in Central California is spontaneously photographed by a woman documenting the migrant laborers who have taken to America&#x2019;s farms in search of work. Little personal information is exchanged, and neither woman has any way of knowing that they have produced what will become the most iconic image of the Great Depression.<br><br>Three vibrant characters anchor the narrative of <i>Mary Coin</i>. Mary, the migrant mother herself, who emerges as a woman with deep reserves of courage and nerve, with private passions and carefully-guarded secrets. Vera Dare, the photographer wrestling with creative ambition who makes the choice to leave her children in order to pursue her work. And Walker Dodge, a present-day professor of cultural history, who discovers a family mystery embedded in the picture. In luminous, exquisitely rendered prose, Silver creates an extraordinary tale from a brief moment in history, and reminds us that although a great photograph can capture the essence of a moment, it only scratches the surface of a life.</p></p><p>Marisa Silver is the author of the novels <i>The God of War </i>(a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize finalist) and <i>No Direction Home</i>; and two story collections, <i>Alone With You</i> and <i>Babe in Paradise </i>(a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book and <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Best Book of the Year). She lives in Los Angeles.At first she thought someone had released a flock of birds into the room. The museum gallery whispered with the sound of wings and flight and she thought of the starlings wheeling through the flat Oklahoma sky, a solid flag of them waving in the currents of a wind. Was that seventy years ago? More?...&nbsp;A child&#x2019;s cry broke through. Mary, always keen to a child&#x2019;s distress, turned towards the sound. And there, across the room, hung the familiar charcoal gray shapes of the image that shadowed her life....&nbsp;The gallery had grown quieter and, for a moment, Mary was alone with the picture.&nbsp;She saw her reflection in the glass. There they were. Two women named Mary Coin. If they met on the street in the high heat of a summer&#x2019;s afternoon, they would be polite in the old fashioned way to show they meant one another no harm. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; they would say in passing. &#x201c;My, but isn&#x2019;t it a wretched day?&#x201d;</p><h2>TEKS Math, Course 3, Volume 2, Texas Edition, 9780076656936, 0076656934, 2015</h2><p>teks texas, math course 3 vol 1 and 2</p><p></p><h2>100 Songs for Kids: Easy Guitar with Notes &amp; Tab</h2><p>(Easy Guitar).

Khnopff achieved widespread acclaim during his lifetime for his moody, dreamlike paintings, as well as his numerous commissioned portraits, designs for costumes and sets for the theater and opera, photography, sculpture, book illustrations, and writings. Khnopff was a reclusive personality, and in 1900 he focused his attention on the design and construction of a lavish, secluded home and studio in Brussels, a structure that became deeply entwined with the artist&#x2019;s work and sense of self. Although the house was demolished in 1936, Draguet uses new archival research to reconstruct its spaces and explore the home as emblematic of the artist, guiding the reader through Khnopff&#x2019;s very personal world and analyzing his art in the context of its generative surroundings.</p><p>This beautifully illustrated volume offers a comprehensive look at a key member of the artistic vanguard of fin-de-si�cle Europe, written by one of the world&#x2019;s greatest authorities on the subject.<br> &nbsp;<b>Michel Draguet</b> is professor of art history at the Universit� libre de Bruxelles&nbsp;and director general of the Mus�es royeaux des Beaux-Arts in Belgium.</p><h2>Bay of Pigs: CIA's Cuban Disaster, April 1961 (Cold War 1945&#x2013;1991)</h2><p>Perhaps not in casualties but as far as prestige and standing in the world were concerned, the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 was the worst disaster to befall the USA since the War of 1812 when British forces burned the White House. Badly planned, badly organized, the affair was littered with mistakes from start to finish &#x2013; not least with an inept performance by John F Kennedy and his new administration.<br><br>Supposedly an attempt by Cuban exiles to regain their homeland, the whole operation was funded and equipped by the USA. When things began to go wrong with the landings at Playa Larga and Playa Giron on the southern coast of Cuba President Kennedy and his advisers began overruling military decisions with the result that the invading Brigade 2506 &#x2013; made up of Cuban exiles &#x2013; was left with little or no air cover, limited ammunition and no easy escape.<br><br>Fidel Castro made great play of his success and American failure at the Bay of Pigs. He, like Nikita Khrushchev, thought Kennedy was weak: the Cuban Missile Crisis of the following year was almost an inevitable consequence of the disaster.</p><p>Phil Carradice is a well-known writer and historian with over 60 books to his credit. A poet, story teller and broadcaster, his most recent books are &#39;The Cuban Missile Crisis&#39; (Pen and Sword), &#39;The Call Up&#39; (Fonthill) and the novel &#39;Stargazers&#39; for Accent Press.

Na�ve and fresh from the Japanese countryside, Eiji encounters every obstacle imaginable in his quest, from his father's--and in-laws'--reluctance for the encounter to occur (Eiji is the bastard son) to fiery entanglements with <i>yakuza</i> (the Japanese mafia) to the overwhelming size and anonymity of Tokyo itself. <p> The novel is cartoonish in that Eiji has a vivid and violent imagination that fills the book with daydreams. When not chain-smoking, forlorn Eiji wanders the city following vague or cryptic leads that invariably dead-end or land him back among yakuza. Mitchell (author of the critically acclaimed <i>Ghostwritten</i>) has a smart, eclectic writing style that seems foreign, and the novel is well paced, but the yakuza encounters are too cinematic, complete with unusual torture and pyrotechnics. Moreover, in addition to Eiji's daydreams, the last half of the book contains excerpts from the diaries of his great uncle's World War II naval heroics and bizarre short stories that Eiji reads while hiding--the latter of which make for tedious reading. </p><p> <i>Number9Dream</i> is crafted from too many disparate components; it does not seem to be a full expression, but an overly crowded one. Readers will sympathize with Eiji and his search, but in the end will wonder what effect, if any, all the extraneous forces had on him. The book provides many fun moments, but ultimately it doesn't really add up to the sum of its parts. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><br>Praise for David Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Ghostwritten</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell . . . has a gift for fiction&#x2019;s natural pleasures&#x2014;intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell is a fabulous ghostwriter fueled by a brilliant imagination and buoyed by beautifully descriptive writing. <i>Ghostwritten </i>is a brave new book for a brave new world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;To complement its heady themes, G<i>hostwritten</i> is also elegantly composed, gracefully plotted, and full of humor. . . . [It] recall[s] Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in its emotional scope and its ambitions. Like the great Russians, Mitchell makes us feel that more is at stake than individual lives, although it&#x2019;s by individual lives that pain and loss are measured.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;An intricately assembled Faberg� egg of a novel, full of sly and sometimes beautiful surprises. . . . In an era in which much literary fiction is characterized by unearned ironies and glib cynicism, it&#x2019;s hard not to be impressed by the humanism that animates Mitchell&#x2019;s book. . . . Worth a dozen of the morally anorexic novels that regularly come down the pipe.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Daniel Mendelsohn, <i>New York</i> magazine<br><br>&#x201c;Reminiscent at times of DeLillo, Murakami, and science fiction, especially in its continual probing of what is real and what is not, this book remains very much its own thing. . . . It is a thrill to read a piece of fiction this engrossing, challenging, urgent, and ultimately, so very new.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unlike so many other chroniclers of the twenty-first-century pastiche&#x2014;an industry dominated by ad men and feature-writers, not novelists&#x2014;Mitchell has set out to craft actual characters, not archetypes. The result is a dazzling piece of work.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i> <br><br>&#x201c;This is one of the best first novels I&#x2019;ve read for a long time. . . . I read a proof of this on a transatlantic flight. When I got off in Atlanta, I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. I pulled my luggage in one hand along corridors and escalators, and held David Mitchell&#x2019;s last chapter up to my nose with the other. I finished at the carousel. It seemed appropriate. And it&#x2019;s even better the second time.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;A. S.

Formerly a National Park Service ranger and then a battlefield guide, he has lived in Gettysburg since 1971.The author has selected the diaries of two participants in the Battle of Gettysburg: Thomas Lewis Ware, a Confederate soldier from Georgia, and Franklin Horner, a Union soldier from Pennsylvania, and follows them for 35 days as each one marches toward Gettysburg. Their experiences, thoughts, and feelings are recounted exactly as written in their diaries. The author's commentary follows each day's entry and gives insight and detail as to location, army units involved, food and housing, and background information on each individual to better understand the diary entries. The author then takes the two participants through the Battle of Gettysburg, their involvement in each phase of the battle, and the final outcome as it affects them. Lastly, the author maps out routes of march for each of the two participants, using modern highways for anyone wishing to duplicate the marches. The book gives interesting insight into the thoughts and feelings of two common soldiers as they approach a major battle.

Che could sense whether a room had been loved or lived or argued in.<br><br>Perdu also listened every Sunday to how Madame Bomme and the widows&#x2019; club giggled like girls at the dirty books he slipped them behind their stuffy relatives&#x2019; backs.<br><br>The snatches of life that could be overheard in the house at number 27 Rue Montagnard were like a sea lapping the shores of Perdu&#x2019;s silent isle.<br><br>He had been listening for more than twenty years. He knew his neighbors so well that he was sometimes amazed by how little they knew about him (not that he minded). They had no idea that he owned next to no furniture apart from a bed, a chair and a clothes rail&#x2014;no knickknacks, no music, no pictures or photo albums or three-piece suite or crockery (other than for himself)&#x2014;or that he had chosen such simplicity of his own free will. The two rooms he still occupied were so empty that they echoed when he coughed. The only thing in the living room was the giant jigsaw puzzle on the floor. His bedroom was furnished with a bed, the ironing board, a reading light and a garment rail on wheels containing three identical sets of clothing: gray trousers, white shirt, brown V-neck sweater. In the kitchen were a stove-top coffee pot, a tin of coffee and a shelf stacked with food. Arranged in alphabetical order. Maybe it was just as well that no one saw this.<br><br>And yet he harbored a strange affection for 27 Rue Montagnard&#x2019;s residents. He felt inexplicably better when he knew that they were well&#x2014;and in his unassuming way he tried to make a contribution. Books were a means of helping. Otherwise he stayed in the background, a small figure in a painting, while life was played out in the foreground.<br><br>However, the new tenant on the third floor, Maximilian Jordan, wouldn&#x2019;t leave Monsieur Perdu in peace. Jordan wore specially made earplugs with earmuffs over them, plus a woolly hat on cold days. Ever since the young author&#x2019;s debut novel had made him famous amid great fanfare, he&#x2019;d been on the run from fans who would have given their right arms to move in with him. Meanwhile, Jordan had developed a peculiar interest in Monsieur Perdu.<br><br>While Perdu was on the landing arranging the chair beside the kitchen table, and the vase on top, the crying stopped.<br><br>In its place he heard the squeak of a floorboard that someone was trying to walk across without making it creak.<br><br>He peered through the pane of frosted glass in the green door. Then he knocked twice, very gently.<br><br>A face moved closer. A blurred, bright oval.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; the oval whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a chair and a table for you.&#x201d;<br><br>The oval said nothing.<br><br>I have to speak softly to her. She&#x2019;s cried so much she&#x2019;s probably all dried out and she&#x2019;ll crumble if I&#x2019;m too loud.<br><br>&#x201c;And a vase. For flowers. Red flowers, for instance. They&#x2019;d look really pretty on the white table.&#x201d;<br><br>He had his cheek almost pressed up against the glass.<br><br>He whispered, &#x201c;But I can give you a book as well.&#x201d;<br><br>The light in the staircase went out.<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of book?&#x201d; the oval whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;The consoling kind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need to cry some more. I&#x2019;ll drown if I don&#x2019;t. Can you understand that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Sometimes you&#x2019;re swimming in unwept tears and you&#x2019;ll go under if you store them up inside.&#x201d; And I&#x2019;m at the bottom of a sea of tears. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring you a book for crying then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow. Promise me you&#x2019;ll have something to eat and drink before you carry on crying.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know why he was taking such liberties. It must be something to do with the door between them.<br><br>The glass misted up with her breath.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>When the hall light flared on again, the oval shrank back.<br><br>Monsieur Perdu laid his hand briefly on the glass where her face had been a second before.<br><br>And if she needs anything else, a chest of drawers or a potato peeler, I&#x2019;ll buy it and claim I had it already.<br><br>He went into his empty flat and pushed the bolt across. The door leading into the room behind the bookcase was still open. The longer Monsieur Perdu looked in there, the more it seemed as though the summer of 1992 were rising up out of the floor. The cat jumped down from the sofa on soft, velvet paws and stretched. The sunlight caressed a bare back, the back turned and became &#x2014;&#x2014;. She smiled at Monsieur Perdu, rose from her reading position and walked toward him naked, with a book in her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you finally ready? asked &#x2014;&#x2014;.<br><br>Monsieur Perdu slammed the door.<br><br>No.<br><br>3<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Monsieur Perdu said again the following morning. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not sell you this book.&#x201d;<br><br>Gently he pried Night from the lady&#x2019;s hand. Of the many novels on his book barge&#x2014;the vessel moored on the Seine that he had named Literary Apothecary&#x2014;she had inexplicably chosen the notorious bestseller by Maximilian &#x201c;Max&#x201d; Jordan, the earmuff wearer from the third floor in Rue Montagnard.<br><br>The customer looked at the bookseller, taken aback.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Max Jordan doesn&#x2019;t suit you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Max Jordan doesn&#x2019;t suit me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. He&#x2019;s not your type.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My type. Okay. Excuse me, but maybe I should point out to you that I&#x2019;ve come to your book barge for a book. Not a husband, mon cher Monsieur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With all due respect, what you read is more important in the long term than the man you marry, ma ch�re Madame.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at him through eyes like slits.<br><br>&#x201c;Give me the book, take my money, and we can both pretend it&#x2019;s a nice day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is a nice day, and tomorrow is the start of summer, but you&#x2019;re not going to get this book. Not from me. May I suggest a few others?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right, and flog me some old classic you&#x2019;re too lazy to throw overboard where it can poison the fish?&#x201d; She spoke softly to begin with, but her volume kept increasing.<br><br>&#x201c;Books aren&#x2019;t eggs, you know. Simply because a book has aged a bit doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s gone bad.&#x201d; There was now an edge to Monsieur Perdu&#x2019;s voice too. &#x201c;What is wrong with old? Age isn&#x2019;t a disease. We all grow old, even books. But are you, is anyone, worth less, or less important, because they&#x2019;ve been around for longer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s absurd how you&#x2019;re twisting everything, all because you don&#x2019;t want me to have that stupid Night book.&#x201d;<br><br>The customer&#x2014;or rather noncustomer&#x2014;tossed her purse into her luxury shoulder bag and tugged at the zip, which got stuck.&nbsp;<br><br> Perdu felt something welling up inside him, a wild feeling, anger, tension&#x2014;only it had nothing to do with this woman. He couldn&#x2019;t hold his tongue, though. He hurried after her as she strode angrily through the belly of the book barge and called out to her in th...</p><h2>Animalia</h2><p>An alphabet book with fantastic and detailed pictures, bearing such labels as &#34;Lazy lions lounging in the local library.&#34;</p><p>What's this elaborate illustration? "Horrible Hairy Hogs Hurrying Homewards on Heavily Harnessed Horses," of course. Graeme Base's astonishingly creative oeuvre begins with <i>Animalia</i>, the 1993 alphabet book that challenges the standard idea of how long reading a book for small kids ought to take. <i>Animalia</i>, like many of Base's books, is a vast puzzle, built with entrancing pictures that unfold into layers and layers of objects--all matched to each page's corresponding letter. Base leaves us stunned and amazed, painting reflections into the oddest surfaces and driving the urge to page-turn. This wonderful picture book works for 2-year-olds, 5-year-olds, and adults alike--something few other alphabet books can manage. <i>--Andrew Bartlett</i><p><b>Graeme Base</b> received international acclaim for his smash hit <i>Animalia,</i> which has sold more than three million copies. Among his many other beloved and bestselling books are <i>The Jewel Fish of Karnak, Enigma, The Eleventh Hour, The Water Hole, The Legend of the Golden Snail, </i>and many more. He lives with his family in Melbourne, Australia.</p></p><h2>Under the Skin</h2><p>Under the Skin centers around a female character, Isserley, obsessed with picking up lone, male hitch-hickers. As the novel unfolds, the reader is drawn inexorably into a completely unexpected and increasingly terrifying world.</p><p>In the opening pages of <i>Under the Skin</i>, a lone female is scouting the Scottish Highlands in search of well-proportioned men: "Isserley always drove straight past a hitch-hiker when she first saw him, to give herself time to size him up. She was looking for big muscles: a hunk on legs. Puny, scrawny specimens were no use to her." At this point, the reader might be forgiven for anticipating some run-of-the-mill psychosexual drama. But commonplace expectation is no help when it comes to Michel Faber's strange and unsettling first novel; small details, then major clues, suggest that something deeply bizarre is afoot. What are the reasons for Isserley's extensive surgical scarring, her thick glasses, her excruciating backache? Who are the solitary few who work on the farm where her cottage is located? And why are they all nervous about the arrival of someone called Amlis Vess? <p> The ensuing narrative is of such cumulative, compelling strangeness that it almost defies description. The one thing that can be said with certainty is that <i>Under the Skin</i> is unlike anything else you have ever read. Faber's control of his medium is nearly flawless. Applying the rules of psychological realism to a fictional world that is both terrifying and unearthly, he nonetheless compels the reader's absolute identification with Isserley. Not even the author's fine short-story collection, <i>Some Rain Must Fall</i>, prepared us for such mastery. <i>Under the Skin</i> is ultimately a reviewer's nightmare and a reader's dream: a book so distinctive, so elegantly written, and so original that one can only urge everybody in earshot to experience it, and soon. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>Now a Major Motion Picture "Alternately gorgeous and terrifying, lyrical and brutal, "Under the Skin "compels and teases . . . Satisfying and successful." "Newsday"In this haunting, entrancing novel, Michel Faber introduces us to Isserley, a female driver who cruises the Scottish Highlands picking up hitchhikers. Scarred and awkward, yet strangely erotic and threatening, she listens to her hitchhikers as they open up to her, revealing clues about who might miss them if they should disappear. A grotesque and comical allegory, "Under the Skin" takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion to present a surreal representation of contemporary society run amok."A wonderful book painful, lyrical, frightening, brilliant . . . I couldn t put it down." Kate Atkinson, author of "Life After Life"Finalist for the Whitbread AwardMichel Faber is the author of "The Crimson Petal and the White, The Courage Consort, "and "Some Rain Must Fall."

Reviewing MacLeod in the <em>New York Times</em>, Louise Erdrich wrote, "the young eventually realize that though they speak English, the old language [Gaelic] is internalized, that the sound and meaning of it rise to haunt them in the same way that the ancient mythologies and superstitions, spun through generations, exert an ineluctable hold."<br><br> Joyce Carol Oates gives us a precise image of the experience of reading these stories: "that sudden feeling of insecurity that comes to a traveler in unmapped country; a sense of immediacy, cinematic in its vividness."</p><p>"Once there was a family with a Highland name who lived beside the sea." So begins "As Birds Bring Forth the Sun," a 1985 entry from <i>Island</i>. The story continues, "And the man had a dog of which he was very fond." And there you have the basic elements of an Alistair MacLeod story: dog, family, and sea. The author--whose 2000 novel <i>No Great Mischief</i> won him a measure of long-overdue acclaim--shuffles these elements into a surprisingly infinite variety of configurations, always with the same precise, confident, quiet language.<p> His big theme is the abandonment of the rural. Though his characters live in the fishing communities of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, the seaside isn't a place where they dwell contentedly. In half the stories, young men and boys feel a pull toward academe and the center of the country. In the other half, academically successful middle-aged men return to the wild eastern coast of Canada to try to reclaim the life they left behind. Both dilemmas are impossible to resolve--no one can be both a city mouse and a country mouse--and MacLeod wisely doesn't offer easy solutions. </p><p> What makes the writing sing, though, is the specificity of his descriptions of rural life. He tells you exactly how things work: "The sheep move in and out of their lean-to shelter, restlessly stamping their feet or huddling together in tightly packed groups. A conspiracy of wool against the cold." The people here are ultimately defined by the physical world, and MacLeod has a farmer's visceral feel for geography. As he writes in "The Lost Salt Gift of Blood": "Even farther out, somewhere beyond Cape Spear lies Dublin and the Irish coast; far away but still the nearest land, and closer now than is Toronto or Detroit, to say nothing of North America's more western cities; seeming almost hazily visible now in imagination's mist." This is regional fiction in the best sense: it belongs to one perfectly evoked place. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>11 cds</p><h2>The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of Wild Flowers and Flora of the Americas</h2><p>Authoritative guide to more than 750 wildflowers of the USA, Canada, Central and South America.

Jennifer resolves to improve her life, and that means that she's going to figure out a way to have a personal life in addition to her demanding legal career <i>and </i>her duties as superhero. <br><br>I love to write snark and banter and it was fun to let loose with Shulky's bold and confident antics. Who wouldn't want to hang out with a 6'7" jade green party girl? Jennifer is a very shy California girl in the heart of Manhattan, and I imagined her a little like Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) tossing her hat in the air -- "you're going to make it after all." She may be quiet in person, but get her into a courtroom and she's ferocious.<br><br>I fell in love with this wonderful Marvel character, and I really hope that readers of <i>The She-Hulk Diaries</i> will fall in love with her, too!<br><br>Marta AcostaJennifer Walters is a lawyer and the giant green Marvel superhero known as She-Hulk, now transferred from comics to prose in this super-chick-lit novel. Jen finds herself between jobs and between apartments at New Years, not to mention between relationships. She also has a PR problem due to She-Hulk&#39;s hard-partying habits. Jen signs on with the law firm QUIRC, resolving actively start looking for love and to have fun in ways that won&#39;t get her fired. Of course, because this is a She-Hulk book, this ends up involving clones, supervillains and LARPing. Acosta&#39;s research shows as she captures the personality and humor of her main character and the Marvel universe for veteran readers and the uninitiated alike. The book&#39;s only problems are romance novel and chick-lit tropes that don&#39;t fit She-Hulk nearly as well, such as her self-deprecating envy of other women&#39;s beauty. Also, despite dating many of Marvel&#39;s superheroes, Jen has been secretly pining for the book&#39;s newly introduced love interest since college, because apparently True Love doesn&#39;t happen after thirty. Still, with trademark She-Hulk moments of comedy such as a sinisterly addicting smoothie chain and a particularly random appearance of Doctor Doom, this is a fun and lighthearted read.

The world&#x2019;s oldest epic poem is the Epic of Gilgamesh, the tale of a hero who was part god, part man. But just in the past century a thrilling discovery was made the 4,000-year-old stories of his powerful sister, the goddess Inanna.<br><br>Inanna is a goddess who embodies the quest for growth. Her stories tell how she develops from childish inexperience and youthful exuberance into maturity and gains the powers to create, to destroy and to name.

With global economies in ruins and all-out world war more than a possibility, the U.S government turned to the Union Aerospace Corporation, giving it carte blanche on the legendary red planet of Mars in a desperate bid to construct an off-world outpost that might provide resources, a military advantage...as well as something so secret that even members of government don't have a clue about it.... <br> <br> Special Ops Marine Lieutenant John Kane was once a careerist simply glad to have a job, and couldn't care less about politics just as long as Uncle Sam's check cleared. But that was before he listened to his conscience and disobeyed a direct order. Busted down to private, Kane has been reassigned to the "U.S. Space Marines" -- the private army of the UAC -- with the prospect of becoming little more than a glorified security guard on Mars.... <br> <br> Now Lt. Kane's fate leads him to Mars City -- part environmental community, part lab center, and all owned and protected by the UAC. It's a strange world with a fatal environment, and the thousands who live and work within the city have already begun to think of themselves as Martians. And away from Mars City, at the strange ancient sites uncovered on the planet, a small squad of marines stand guard while scientists uncover wall glyphs and search for artifacts, having already found something that is so far amazing and inexplicable -- including the relic called "U1," nicknamed "the Soul Cube" -- and unknown to all, the bringer of destructive chaos and unspeakable horror....</p><p>MATTHEW COSTELLO is an award-winning novelist, screenwriter and video game writer.

He tapped it, then turned to the three men following behind him. </p><p> "So -- what's on the other side?" he asked. Two of the men -- Elliot Swann, the company lawyer, and Jack Campbell, the head of security -- turned to the man in uniform. Medals and colorful bars spoke of experience; three stars indicated a general. </p><p> <i>A general in the space marines</i>, Kelliher thought. Less a U.S. government military unit than a Union Aerospace Corporation private security force. </p><p> "Mars," the general replied. "Right now, nothing but a big flat expanse of red dirt and rock." </p><p> Kelliher nodded. He knew the project was behind schedule, even though no one had told him so. Nobody ever told him the truth about the problems. Nobody ever told him anything they thought he didn't want to hear. </p><p> Worst of all, he'd have to go back Earthside and report to his father, the great Tommy Kelliher. Sitting in his castle-like Newport Beach estate, monitored by the best medical help that money could buy, kept alive by drugs and machines that most of the world's hospitals hadn't even heard about. </p><p> Tommy Kelliher. UAC founder emeritus. </p><p> Ian was now the UAC chairman. But as long as the pumps forced air into his father's lungs, Ian would still have to talk to the man who made UAC the amazingly powerful global business it was today. After all, how many businesses owned an entire planet? </p><p> Sure, Mars was being developed as a "joint venture" by the United States government and the UAC, but there was no one on Capitol Hill who didn't know the truth. Mars would be a UAC operation, and the good old U.S. of A. was merely along for the ride. </p><p> Kelliher took a step closer to General Hayden. </p><p> "General, my supervisors say that the work out there, connecting the units...that it's all not going as easily as anticipated." </p><p> Hayden nodded. The man had seen his share of battles -- or "skirmishes," as the government liked to call the never-ending little wars that plagued planet Earth -- so he didn't exactly shrink, or back away a step, but a thin line of sweat broke out on his brow. </p><p> "True, there have been difficulties. Some rock formations went much deeper than we thought. The surveys were completely wrong in certain places -- " </p><p> The other two men stayed quiet. Not their job to add heat to this dish. </p><p> "But, General," said Kelliher, "you have done everything you can to help the teams, correct mistakes, to keep us moving forward, yes?" </p><p> "Full speed ahead, Ian." </p><p> <i>As if we're in the navy now</i>. And not in the middle of the largest construction project ever attempted anywhere, let alone in a hostile environment. </p><p> Nothing even came close. </p><p> "Good. Full speed, as you say. Okay -- so now I want to <i>see</i>." </p><p> Hayden's eyes narrowed. "See? See what?" Another tap of the metal. "Outside. The work, the progress, talk to some my supervisors. And -- oh yes -- " A pause, so Hayden knew what Kelliher's real purpose was. "I want to look around Delta. Best tell Betruger." </p><p> Hayden didn't move. </p><p> "And how about we get started now, General?" </p><p> Hayden nodded, and then turned and started leading the men away from the unfinished corridor and back to the Administration wing. </p><p> "This will all eventually be sealed," Hayden said, pointing to a series of airlocks. </p><p> Kelliher walked up to them. "They don't look very substantial." </p><p> "As I said...just temporary, until we have completed the other EVA access points," Hayden replied. "But perfectly safe, of course." </p><p> Kelliher fired a look at his lawyer. "Joining us, Swann?" </p><p> "That's all right, sir. I can wait -- " </p><p> "No, really. I insist. Join us," Kelliher said. </p><p> Campbell had already gotten into an EVA suit. A frequent visitor to the Red Planet, Campbell had supervised the implementation of the security systems for the ever-growing Mars City perimeter. </p><p> <i>Mars City... </i></p><p><i> A prosaic name for such a massive undertaking</i>, Kelliher thought. A city on another planet. And while there would be no towering skyscrapers -- in fact, much of the base would be underground -- it would ultimately rival many of its counterparts back home in size, scope, and -- to be sure -- ambition. </p><p> Big plans were in the works for Mars City. When it was done, anyway. One of these days. </p><p> Kelliher took a suit offered by one of the marines on guard, and immediately felt the weight of it. "We need something this heavy? I thought Martian summer was in full swing." </p><p> Hayden pulled on his suit with another marine helping him. "Last night we got hit with icy dust storms from the poles. And in the morning, it's always cold. So we need a heavy suit. Should get warmer by lunch." </p><p> Kelliher turned to the climate readout on the side of the EVA ports. Minus 43 degrees. South Pole weather. But here it could get a lot worse, down to minus 250 degrees. And every now and then, at the Martian equator you'd get a balmy 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Short-sleeve weather by Martian standards. </p><p> The marine assisting them brought over the lightweight helmets, consisting of a clear headpiece that attached to the compact compressed air tanks fitted into slots in the back. </p><p> <i>Not much worse than gearing up for a deep ocean dive</i>, Kelliher thought. </p><p> This would be only his second time out on the Martian soil. For some inexplicable reason, he found himself fraught with tension. </p><p> The Martian Rover, with its driver in front, sat parked, waiting just outside the airlocks. </p><p> "Let's walk instead," Kelliher said. </p><p> "Right," Hayden replied, his voice a bit too loud in Kelliher's helmet. "We can walk." Kelliher immediately adjusted the controls on his right forearm. Didn't need the general deafening him. </p><p> Even just a few feet away from what would be the Administration Wing, Kelliher could see the immense progress. The Mars City reception area looked nearly done, ready to connect to Admin. And past that -- </p><p> "That's Security and Combat?" Kelliher asked. </p><p> "Yes," Hayden replied. "Marine Command is already based there. The infirmary is up and running. Most of the marines are already bivouacked over there." </p><p> "And that?" Kelliher pointed past Marine Headquarters to a large sprawl of construction just to the right and behind it, not yet connected to any of the other bases. </p><p> "Alpha Labs. Fully self-sustained. Already operational. Like all the labs." </p><p> Kelliher nodded. Each part of the base could exist independently of the others, with air, water processing, even -- to some extent -- food production. Alpha Labs was already busy carrying out experiments designed to make Mars more sustainable -- everything from the implications of low-grav hydroponics to the feasibility of using the great Martian dust storms to increase CO2 gases and accelerate the greenhouse effect. </p><p> The holy grail for Alpha Labs would be to create a breathable atmosphere on Mars. <i>My God, that would really be something.</i> </p><p> "Looking good, General. I assume the construction team can meet us after the tour?" </p><p> "Absolutely. I've invited them all for lunch." </p><p> "Fine. Just don't feed them. We're behind schedule enough." Kelliher made that comment flatly; no joke there. Every day they lagged behind schedule kept giant payments from the U.S. government from kicking in. Mars City had to be completed, and soon, or the UAC would start to bleed millions. </p><p> Kelliher looked at Hayden. "Just two more things to see now, General. Delta, of course. And the site." </p><p> "Yes, sir." </p><p> Hayden didn't sound happy. The general never sounded happy when the site was mentioned. <i>Well, then. Fuck him.</i> </p><p> Copyright � 2008 by id Software, Inc.</p></p><h2>Eddy Merckx: Cycling&#39;s Greatest Champion</h2><p>Combing through years of cycling literature and press archives, and seeking out friends, rivals, and the man himself, the author pieces together the disparate elements of Eddy Merckx&#39;s life.

But despite her best efforts the baby, Aminat, is born nine months later at Soviet Birthing Center Number 134. Much to Rosa&#x2019;s surprise and delight, dark eyed Aminat is a Tartar through and through and instantly becomes the apple of her grandmother&#x2019;s eye. While her good for nothing husband Kalganow spends his days feeding pigeons and contemplating death at the city park, Rosa wages an epic struggle to wrestle Aminat away from Sulfia, whom she considers a woefully inept mother. When Aminat, now a wild and willful teenager, catches the eye of a sleazy German cookbook writer researching Tartar cuisine, Rosa is quick to broker a deal that will guarantee all three women a passage out of the Soviet Union. But as soon as they are settled in the West, the uproariously dysfunctional ties that bind mother, daughter and grandmother begin to fray. <br><br>Told with sly humor and an anthropologist&#x2019;s eye for detail, <i>The Hottest Dishes of the Tartar Cuisine</i> is the story of three unforgettable women whose destinies are tangled up in a family dynamic that is at turns hilarious and tragic.</p><p><b>Alina Bronsky</b>'s first novel, <i>Broken Glass Park, </i>was a finalist for one of Europe's most celebrated literary awards, the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize. It was hailed by <i>Publishers Weekly </i>as a "riveting debut," while the <i>Boston Globe </i>described it as "a vivid depiciton of contemporary adolescence under pressure." <i>The Hottest Dishes of the Tartar Cuisine, </i>nominated for the prestigious German Book Prize, is her second novel. She lives in Germany. <br><br><b>Tim Mohr </b>is a former Berlin club DJ whose previous translations include <i>Broken Glass Park</i>, Charlotte Roche's <i>Wetlands</i>, and Dorothea Dieckmann's <i>Guantanamo, </i>for which he won the Three Percent award for best translation of 2007. He collaborated with Duff McKagan on <i>It's So Easy (and other lies), </i>McKagan's forthcoming memoir.Starred Review. Rosa Achmetowna, the frightening narrator of Bronsky's dark and wily latest (after Broken Glass Park), is a difficult person to like, much less love. She lives in a cramped Soviet apartment with her husband, teenage daughter Sulfia, and a nosy, disagreeable roommate. Brusque, brimming with bile, and ever judgmental, she is less than pleased when the "rather stupid" Sulfia winds up pregnant. Rosa immediately tries a variety of crude home remedies for aborting Sulfia's baby&#x2014;but nine months later, Aminat, is born. Rosa is fundamentally nasty, yes, but she instantly falls in love with Aminat (who coincidentally bears a striking resemblance to Rosa), tries to wrestle Aminat away from Sulfia, and enjoys watching Aminat grow into a wild, willful thing as Rosa and Sulfia kidnap the little girl back and forth. Rosa's machinations grow increasingly devious until Aminat matures and comes to a crossroads of her own. Rosa is absolutely outrageous, a one-woman wrecking crew with no remorse, an acid tongue, and a conniving opportunist's sense of drive and desperation. Bronsky lands another hit with this hilarious, disturbing, and always irreverent blitz. (May) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

And the crimes of the so-called Indian Killer have triggered a wave of violence and racial hatred. Seattle&#39;s Native Americans are shaken and confused, none more so than John Smith. Born Indian, raised white, Smith desperately yearns for his lost heritage and seeks his elusive true identity. He meets Marie, a stormy Indian activist particularly outraged by people like Jack Wilson, the mystery writer who passes himself as part Indian. As a bigoted radio personality incites whites to seek revenge, tensions mount, Smith fights to slake the anger that engulfs him...and the Indian Killer claims yet another life. Lauded as a poet and author of exceptional lyricism and humor, Sherman Alexie now dips his pen in something stronger-and offers a gritty and eye-opening novel of alienation and justice.</p><p>Native American Sherman Alexie&#39;s new novel is a departure in tone from his lyrical and funny earlier work, which include The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven and Reservation Blues. The main character is an Indian serial killer who incites racial tension by murdering whites in retribution for his people&#39;s history. The killer leaves clear signs of his motives by scalping his victims, and leaving feathers as gestures of Indian defiance. The killer is a conflicted creation--raised by loving white parents, but twisted by loss of his identity as an Indian. Alexie layers the story with complications and ancillary characters, from a rabid talk show host, to vengeance seeking whites, to liberals who find their patronizing espousal of Indian causes no longer so easy.Sherman Alexie is a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian. He earned a 1994 Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writers' Award, was a citation winner for the PEN/Hemingway Award for the Best First Book of Fiction, and was named one of Granta's Best of the Young American Novelists. Alexie is the author of The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven , which served as the basis for a film that premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. His book Reservation Blues won him the Before Columbus Foundation's American Book Award. Alexie's several books of poetry include I Would Steal Horses, Old Shirts &amp; New Skins, First Indian on the Moon , and The Summer of Black Widows.</p><h2>David and the Worry Beast: Helping Children Cope with Anxiety</h2><p>Learning to deal with anxiety is an important step in a child&#39;s healthy emotional growth. Conquering fears, and not avoiding them, is the lesson imparted in this story. David could not stop thinking about the basket he had missed at the end of the big game. He was worried that he might do it again. He was worried that his team mates would be angry with him. He was worried that his parents would not be proud of him. He was also worried about an upcoming math test. In fact, David was worried a lot. &#34;Should I quit the team?&#34; he asked himself. &#34;Should I be sick tomorrow and miss the math test?&#34; Luckily, David finally confided in his parents and school nurse, both of whom gave him support and techniques for controlling the &#34;worry beast&#34; within him.

Her life of music, healing and faith!</p><p>Music therapist Lane's book is both autobiography and splendid religious testimony. For as much as she has been devoted to music, she has been a devout Christian whose faith is of the higher kind Christopher Lasch spoke of in <i>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</i> that trusts in the goodness of being despite the inevitability of suffering. That faith animated and sustained her through the early disappointment of not quite making the grade as a professional concert soprano, the potential mishap of becoming pregnant before marrying, the miscarriage of her second pregnancy, training for a new career and subsequently balancing job and family duties, and then having to deal with breast cancer. From those challenges, she rose to prominence in her field (she brings seemingly instinctive gifts to her chosen work, as her many anecdotes of ministering to the sick and disabled attest--but she never says so) and became a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. With Wilkins' help, Lane makes her inspiring life story theologically compelling, too. <i>Ray Olson</i>If the mark of a true artist is that he or she can see beyond the tangible into the world of the intangible, then Deforia Lane is an artist. Partly as one introspectively engaged in autobiography and partly in her professional role as a resident director of music therapy at University Hospitals of Cleveland's Ireland Cancer Center, at Rainbow Babies and at Children's Hospital, Lane relives the ways in which she has seen music work spiritual and sometimes physical healing upon the ill (including herself) and their families. While Lane certainly seems gifted musically, her larger and more rare gift may be the ability to see grace in everyday occurrences and to name it. This book will appeal to those interested in both music therapy and in the spiritual aspects of music as well. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Letters to the Galatians and Ephesians (The New Daily Study Bible)</h2><p><p>Paul wrote the letter to the Galatians to refute a belief that restricted God's grace alone to those who followed Jewish ritualistic law.

The gentle Hodag has the head of an ox, feet of a bear, back of a dinosaur, and tail of an alligator. In this adventure, Olee Swenson and his fellow lumberjacks must think of clever ways to save him from the animal catchers who have come to take him to the zoo. These strong, macho guys conscientiously consider the feelings of the Hodag and the inhumanity of putting a wild animal in captivity. In contrast, the city slickers are three times outsmarted and outmaneuvered by the lumberjacks and sent home empty-handed. The black-and-white prints, full and double-page, enhance the woodsy tale with a style that places the adventure at the turn of the 20th century. The animal catchers are stylishly dressed in vests and knickers, and topped off with pith helmets or bowlers. With their nets and other essentials for catching a wild animal, they have a slight resemblance to Teddy Roosevelt on safari. The lumberjacks, practically clad in boots and wooly hats, look right at home in the great outdoors. The monotone prints create good texture for both the hairy Hodag and the bearded woodsmen. This story will be enjoyed both as a read-aloud and a read-alone.<i>&#x2013;Carolyn Janssen, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is an amazing verse novel which provides a panoramic view of the early Victorian age in London. The dominant presence in the work however, is the narrator Aurora Leigh, as she develops her ideas on art, love, God, the "Woman Question", and society.</p><p>Kerry McSweeney also edited Thomas Carlyle&#39;s Sartor Resartus for the World&#39;s Classics.Novel in blank verse by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, published in 1857. The first-person narrative, which comprises some 11,000 lines, tells of the heroine's childhood and youth in Italy and England, her self-education in her father's hidden library, and her successful pursuit of a literary career. Initially resisting a marriage proposal by the philanthropist Romney Leigh, Aurora later surrenders her independence and weds her faithful suitor, whose own idealism has also since been tempered by experience. Aurora's career, Romney's social theories, and a melodramatic subplot concerning forced prostitution elicit the author's vivid observations on the importance of poetry, the individual's responsibility to society, and the victimization of women. Although it was a great popular success, Aurora Leigh was not admired by critics. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encylopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Morland Dynasty 18: The Abyss</h2><p><p>1833: the industrial age is sweeping through England and the Stephensons are planning the greatest engineering scheme ever undertaken- a railway line from Liverpool to London.</p><p>At Morland Place, Nicholas had hoped that his brother Benedict, had been banished forever, but railway fever has brought Benedict back to Yorkshire as an engineer on the Leeds &amp; Selby line.

During the eighth and seventh centuries BC its rulers controlled Egypt as pharaohs of the 25th Dynasty. Yet much of the history of the kingdom is obscure, with it being overshadowed by its more famous neighbour. Using both ancient classical sources and modern data from archaeological digs, this work explores the history and culture of the Kushites. It illustrates all aspects of life and shows how the kingdom interacted over the centuries with Egypt.</p><p>Derek A. Welsby has been directing excavations in Sudan since 1982 on behalf of the British Institute in Eastern Africa and the Sudan Archaeological Research Sopciety. He is currently an Assistant Keeper in the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan in The British Museum, with special responsibility for the Sudanese collections...a reliable, up-to-date guide....Welsby's book presents the archaeological evidence extensively in illustrations and plates. Welsby's early and concluding chapters (1-3, 9) trace the rise, greatness, and "fall" of the Kushite kingdom in great detail and with frequent reference to points of scholarly disagreement. The book's middle chapters (5-8) treat a variety of topics: "Religion and Funerary Ritual", "Architecture", "Urban and Rural Settlement", "The Economy", and "The Arts and the Art of Writing". They rely heavily on architectural remains and plans and on artefacts excavated in temples, palaces, towns, and cemeteries.Kushite pyramids and tombs (and their grave goods), inscribed stelae, statues, reliefs, skeletons, and pots [and] such objects of daily life as clothing, musical instruments, toys, and cosmetics. <p>[Welsby's] aim...is to "provide a balanced account of the history of the Kingdom of Kush and the lifestyle of its inhabitants throughout its thousand-ye! ar history". In this The Kingdom of Kush admirably succeeds....it is hard not to agree with the author that "[s]tudying the Kingdom of Kush is like a detective story" full of "intriguing problems"... -- <i>Classical Bulletin 75, no. 2 - 1999</i></p></p><h2>The Best of Zane Grey, Outdoorsman: Hunting and Fishing Tales (Classics of American Sport)</h2><p>Stories by a master storyteller recapture an era of wild adventures, legendary sportsmen, and rugged landscapes in some of the world&#39;s most exotic locales.</p><p>George Reiger is a Stackpole Books author.</p><h2>Ninja Secrets of Invisibility</h2><p>Shares the Ninja secret techniques of moving with stealth, evading the enemy, fighting without weapons, and escaping from capture</p><p><b>Ashida Kim</b> is an internationally renowned martial arts expert who teaches and lectures on Ninjitsu around the world.

He is the author of several bestselling novels, including Mila 18, Armageddon, The Angry Hills, Exodus, Trinity, Battle Cry, Mitla Pass and Topaz.Against the backdrop of the 1956 Sinai War, Uris provides a riveting portrait (possibly autobiographical) of a man caught in personal crisis. Gideon Zadok, best-selling novelist and successful Hollywood screenwriter, has come to Israel with his family to research a new novel and to shore up a crumbling marriage. But he jeopardizes that by starting a passionate affair with a beautiful Auschwitz survivor. Zadok is a man wavering on the edge of a breakdown. As the political crisis escalates, and his family is evacuated, Zadok asks to accompany Israeli paratroopers on a desperate mission to seal off the strategic Mitla Pass. The Uris name will make this book much in demand, and if it is not as much of an epic as Exodus or Trinity , it has in Zadok Uris's most fascinating character.

Goethe&#x2019;s way of science is highly unusual because it seeks to draw together the intuitive awareness of art with the rigorous observation and thinking of science. Written by major scholars and practitioners of Goethean science today, this book considers the philosophical foundations of Goethe&#x2019;s approach and applies the method to the real world of nature, including studies of plants, animals, and the movement of water. <br><br>Part I discusses the philosophical foundations of the approach and clarifies its epistemology and methodology; Part II applies the method to the real world of nature; and Part III examines the future of Goethean science and emphasizes its great value for better understanding and caring for the natural environment.</p><p><p>David Seamon is Professor of Architecture at Kansas State University.

As an introduction to &#x2018;Goethe&#x2019;s way of science,&#x2019; this book serves wonderfully well ... Goethe could hardly have wished for more.&#x201d; &#x2015; Worldviews<br><br>&#x201c;I especially like the fact that a major portion of this book is devoted to presenting the results of Goethean Science research. This sets the book apart from all others that have appeared in English. These few books have been heavy on theory and light on results. The integration of theory with practice makes this an important contribution.&#x201d; &#x2015; Bruce K. Kirchoff, Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Greensboro<br><br>&#x201c;Goethe&#x2019;s Way of Science is a readable, highly original contribution to the study of environment. While challenging common paradigms of positivist, scientific methodology, the book does so unpretentiously, carefully and with much rigor. The range of examples provided by the authors is particularly illumining of the Goethean phenomenology of nature. I recommend this book to ecologists, scientists, philosophers, and students of nature as a thoughtful exploration of alternative ways of seeing the world and its living forms.&#x201d; &#x2015; Ingrid Leman Stefanovic, Department of Philosophy, University of Toronto<br><br>&#x201c;This collection is a dazzling display of what can be done with Goethe&#x2019;s science when applied by competent scholars and researchers.

Into the central theme of necessity, chance, and providence, Steiner introduces a fascinating description of the nature spirits, particularly the gnomes. He also relates his penetrating insights into the question of the death of children and the significant role this plays in earthly culture and the spiritual worlds.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

If not, what provokes violence in the name of religion? Do we mischaracterize religion by focusing too much on its violent side?<br><br>In this intriguing, original study of religious violence, Prof. Hector Avalos offers a new theory for the role of religion in violent conflicts. Starting with the premise that most violence is the result of real or perceived scarce resources, Avalos persuasively argues that religion creates new scarcities on the basis of unverifiable or illusory criteria. Through a careful analysis of the fundamental texts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Dr. Avalos explains how four "scarce" resources have figured repeatedly in creating religious violence: sacred space (churches, temples, holy cities); the creation of holy scriptures (exclusive revelations); group privilege (chosen people, the predestined select few); and salvation (only some are saved). Thus, Avalos shows, religious violence is often the most unnecessary violence of all since the scarce resources over which religious conflicts ensue are not actually scarce or need not be scarce.<br><br>Comparing violence in religious and nonreligious contexts, Avalos makes the compelling argument that if we condemn violence caused by scarce resources as morally objectionable, then we must consider even more objectionable violence provoked by alleged scarcities that cannot be proven to exist. Moreover, he shows how many modern academic biblical scholars and scholars of religion maintain the value of sacred texts despite their violence.<br><br>This serious philosophical examination of the roots of religious violence adds much to our understanding of a perennial source of widespread human suffering.</p><p>Hector Avalos (Ames, IA) is associate professor of Religious Studies at Iowa State University, the author of four books on biblical studies and religion, the former editor of the Journal for the Critical Study of Religion, and executive director of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion.</p><h2>Jumble� Kingdom: A Royal Collection of Regal Puzzles (Jumbles�)</h2><p>For more than 40 years, millions of newspaper readers have delighted in solving the daily Jumble�, which appears in hundreds of national papers and in these puzzle books that offer hours of challenging wordplay and fun.
